# MiniProject3_Group9
This is class room project for the CIS 6397 Text mining course
Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
Find a way to build a corpus (e.g. load the data as large character, split up the input data into individual articles and build a corpus object containing all splitted articles)
clean up the corpus, make sure you separate meta-data from the actual articles
extract features
create summaries on the features as exploration
create some plots for exploration
Topic modeling
create a topic model using your cleaned corpus (you may have to go back into preprocessing steps to make modifications)
re-run the topic modeling multiple times with different parameters and store summaries into output files
discuss the different results in the context described in the overview statement
support your findings with relevant model outputs and visualizations
