欧盟追随了安理会的行动 深度阅读 美中对话成果寥寥 特朗普对华态度或转强硬 为缩小对华贸易逆差 特朗普政府的经济事务官员与中国代表举行了谈判 试图在合作与对抗之间找到平衡点 周三美国和中国的高层经济对话未能取得任何进展 让白宫重新构建美中贸易关系的努力陷入困境 在为时一整天的双边会谈后 美方发表了一篇简短声明 称中方认同两国的共同目标 即双方应共同努力削减美国对中国的贸易逆差 但声明中没有透露双方在多大程度上取得了共识以及何时能够重启谈判 中方官员没有发表声明 如果不能采取实质性措施缩小对中国3 470亿美元的贸易逆差 白宫将面临更大压力 不得不考虑改变对华态度 从合作变为进一步对抗 此次会谈也标志着美国总统特朗普 Donald Trump 与中国国家主席习近平共同提出的 百日计划 的结束 该计划旨在制定一套综合方案 重新理顺两国经贸关系 美方声明还表示 白宫将寻求一项贸易政策 为美国工人和企业营造公平竞争环境 这份声明是由带领美方代表团参与这次会谈的美国商务部部长罗斯 Wilbur Ross 和财政部部长姆努钦 Steven Mnuchin 联名发布的 但声明没有提到美国是否会像特朗普助理近期建议的那样采取单边贸易行动来实现上述目标 会谈结束后仅由美国单方面发表声明的做法打破了近年来中国在奥巴马 Barack Obama 和小布什 George W Bush Jr 执政时期与美国进行类似谈判中的一个惯例 过去 美中两国在会谈结束后通常会发表共同声明 总结双方谈判内容并强调共识 与此次会谈不同的是 特朗普与习近平今年4月份在佛罗里达州会晤后也发表了友好的共同声明 双方在会谈结束后均取消了召开新闻发布会的计划 美国商务部长罗斯 Wilbur Ross 称 他希望重新平衡两国贸易关系 使其向着更加公平和平等的方向发展 罗斯提到了他在两个月前与中国达成了针对特定领域的小范围市场开放协议 但指出最艰难的工作尚未完成 中方官员则提醒称应避免偏离合作的轨道 中国副总理汪洋在双方会谈开始时对罗斯表示 对话不能立即解决所有分歧 但对抗会立即损害双方利益 4月份在佛罗里达州海湖庄园举行峰会期间 特朗普和中国国家主席习近平意外建立了亲切友好的双边关系 在特朗普政府对这种双边关系进行评估之际 周三的磋商从某种意义上来说提醒了官员们现实情况是怎样的 特朗普4月份抛开竞选期间对中国贸易行为的抨击 和习近平达成启动贸易百日计划的共识 希望通过建立新的 全面经济对话 重建两国商业关系 本周举行的会谈是全面经济对话框架下的首次 标志百日计划的结束 同时也将检验两国政府是选择合作还是对抗 最终结果到底是通过合作制定内容广泛的计划 缓解长期存在的贸易紧张关系 还是特朗普制定计划采取更多对抗性措施 特朗普的贸易顾问包括一些长期批评中国的官员 特朗普助手在预备后一种结果时 一直在考察的措施包括对中国的钢铁和太阳能板征收关税 以及收紧中国向美国投资的限制 目前为止美国政府选择不实施这些政策 但特朗普此前暗示对中国贸易问题的进展感到失望 希望能够取得更多成果 他上周向记者表示 必须解决对华贸易问题 因为这种贸易关系并未形成互惠 而且严重失衡 美国和中国的贸易协定是最糟糕的 中美在地缘政治谈判中也面临类似的合作还是对抗的两难局面 在海湖庄园 Mar Lago 峰会之后的几周里 特朗普逐渐偏向了更强硬的路线 特朗普不顾中国政府的反对 批准向台湾出售武器的新交易 本月早些时候还派出轰炸机和海军前往南中国海 South China Sea 中国称南海 巡逻 以维护美国在这些争议水域的航行自由 特朗普还收紧了对涉嫌帮助朝鲜核计划的企业和银行的经济制裁 朝鲜问题尤其有可能影响特朗普的对华策略 特朗普早些时候表示 如果中国政府能帮助遏制朝鲜的核野心 他会在贸易方面放宽对中国的某些限制 但特朗普后来又表示 他对中国在这方面的努力感到失望 这可能令特朗普更有理由挥舞贸易限制大棒 特朗普上周称 在朝鲜问题上 美国的优势在于贸易 特朗普团队最初曾表达过乐观看法 声称他们找到了新办法 可以解决上届政府未能解决的麻烦重重的贸易冲突 今年5月 作为美中关系取得快速进展成果的一部分 两国政府宣布就中方开放农业和金融市场的举措达成协议 中方承诺在本周的对话之前取得切实成果 不过一些美国企业组织和受影响的公司抱怨 虽然表面看来中国政府履行了承诺 但并没有彻底贯彻执行 中国政府消除了承诺消除的贸易壁垒 但仍放任其他障碍存在 本周又出现了新的争执 陶氏化学公司 Dow Chemical Co DOW 称 中国政府5月份承诺加快审批一度搁置的八种生物科技产品 但似乎言而无信 并未对其转基因大豆进行快速审批 中国政府称中间存在误会 陶氏化学的产品未上优先审批名单 财富 世界500强 Fortune 500 企业CEO今年强烈游说白宫 劝白宫缓和咄咄逼人的贸易立场 受此鼓舞中国官员寄望美国商界维持两国平稳的双边贸易关系 汪洋周二在丽思卡尔顿 Ritz Carlton 举行的午宴上向美国商界领袖发表讲话 称美国大选后出现的对特朗普挑起贸易战的担忧已经消退 他向观众问道 为什么会有这种变化 然后对高管们说 答案就在这里 这是你们的功劳 他还补充说 新一届政府转变了方向 这反映了企业界的主流意见 官方会谈的间隙 20名美国和中国的高管本周在华盛顿会晤 以黑石集团 Blackstone Group LP 联合创始人 特朗普顾问苏世民 Stephen Schwarzman 和中国电子商务巨头阿里巴巴集团 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA 创始人马云为首 根据周四发布的一份联合声明 他们试图说服并鼓励各自的政府避免采用传统的贸易救济措施 通过有效协商找出解决争议的办法 苏世民在接受采访时表示 会谈的气氛非常友好 但最近几周 越来越多的行业组织和高管发出了不同的声音 他们鼓励特朗普团队利用本周的会谈 以超过以往的力度敦促中国改革并开放其经济 在本周会谈举行前发布的一份报告中 上海美国商会 American Chamber Commerce Shanghai 表示 百日计划带来了某些早期成果 但重要的是 这些对话也凸显出进行实质性经济改革的重要性 该机构对其成员进行的一项调查显示 成员对市场准入 行业政策及起码的公平公正存在严重的担忧 56 的受访成员表示 中国政府的政策仍然偏向本土公司 对外国公司不利 Jacob Schlesinger Document

Salman是过去两年沙特一系列巨大变革的设计师 被立为王储意味着他左右经济改革方向的权力得以强化 作为沙特阿美上市计划的支持者 他的上位为沙特阿美上市扫除了障碍 这一计划将全速推进 他将继续负责沙特的国防事务 沙特在中东的政策或将变得更具冒险性 背景分析 过去两年 Mohammed bin Salman一直是沙特变革的代言人 他推出紧缩措施以减少油价下跌造成的预算赤字 其中一些举措后来被撤销 他支持沙特阿美上市计划一定程度上是为了推动沙特经济走上私有化道路并增强竞争力 为年轻人创造就业 吸引石油业以外的海外投资 他此前已经承诺 将用大部分发行所得投资于一个经济多元化项目 旨在提升沙特的科技和工业 降低对石油收入的依赖 伊朗 能源 道达尔将推进对伊朗天然气项目的10亿美元投资 道达尔集团6月20日称 计划推进对伊朗巨型天然气田South Pars的10亿美元投资

沙特新王储将给中东带来什么 沙特的王储之争已告一段落 权杖已交到年轻一代王子们的手中 他们决心要让中东知道谁才是这里的老大 形势山雨欲来 沙特国王萨勒曼 Salman 之子穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼 Mohammed bin Salman 周三被立为王储 成为81岁老国王的指定继承人 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼主导了过去两年沙特的一系列巨大变革 打破了这个国家的沉闷 今年刚31岁的穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼领导了沙特对也门的战争 是国内经济改革的设计师 主张用强硬手段遏制伊朗 最近还促使沙特牵头周边国家孤立卡塔尔 相比之下 被废黜的王储 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼57岁的堂兄穆罕默德 本 纳伊夫 Mohammed bin Nayef 被普遍认为是沙特权力集团中一个谨慎而又富有经验的人物 可能对穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼一些较为激进的举动构成牵制 穆罕默德 本 纳伊夫同时还被免去了内政大臣一职 如今 随着穆罕默德 本 纳伊夫被废黜 其内政大臣一职被他33岁的侄子所取代 沙特在中东的政策或将变得更具冒险性 华盛顿智库美国企业研究所 American Enterprise Institute 沙特问题专家Andrew Bowen表示 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼更愿意把沙特的极端民族主义作为巩固国内社会变革的一种手段 他指出 相比稳重 谨慎且务实的穆罕默德 本 纳伊夫 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼性格刚愎 固执 冲动且更具民族主义思想 把这样一个领导人放在那个位置是有风险的 虽然穆罕默德 本 纳伊夫没有公开批评过他的年轻对手 但他主张沙特采用一种更传统的手段 通过幕后策划和建立区域共识来处理问题 包括沙特与卡塔尔和伊朗的关系 相比之下 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼主张炫耀沙特的军事及经济实力 他与阿联酋激进的实际统治者穆罕默德 本 扎耶德 Mohammed bin Zayed 建立了密切关系 沙特政治评论家及商人Ahmad al Ibrahim说 从现在起 沙特会变得更加果断 无论在也门内战还是在与卡塔尔断交的问题上 沙特的外交政策将变得更加开放 更具活力 当然 最近几个月来 穆罕默德 本 纳伊夫在他负责的国内治安领域以外行使权力的空间已经非常有限了 因此 大西洋理事会 Atlantic Council 非常驻研究员 沙特分析人士Mohammed Alyahya指出 尽管沙特王室进行了权力整合 但这个国家的行事作风未必会像许多人预计的那样发生急剧变化 Alyahya预计 沙特在外交 经济政策和国防领域不会出现翻天覆地的变化 因为新王储负责这些领域已经有一段时间 的确 过去几个月 随着穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼扩大自己的势力范围 任命几位年轻王子担任政府关键职务 包括让一位弟弟担任沙特驻美国大使 穆罕默德 本 纳伊夫被排挤出局似乎只是时间问题 但几乎没有人料到形势会发展得如此之快 驻沙特的西方外交家此前一致认为 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼需要拿出一些切实的成绩才会有所行动 随着也门战争陷入泥潭 卡塔尔拒绝让步 沙特王室4月份被迫中止不受欢迎的紧缩措施 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼取得的唯一成功是和美国总统特朗普 Donald Trump 发展出一种令人意外的友好关系 特朗普在去年竞选总统时曾多次抨击沙特 穆罕默德 本 萨勒曼3月份访问了白宫 为上个月高调举行的利雅得峰会开辟了道路 特朗普在会上似乎表示支持沙特领导整个穆斯林世界 之后不久 沙特及其盟友与卡塔尔断交 获得了特朗普的支持 至少在一开始是这样 但到了本周二 就在沙特王室发生变化前几个小时 美国国防部严厉谴责了沙特和阿联酋对卡塔尔实施的禁运 美国在这一地区的一个主要军事基地就位于卡塔尔 对许多中东人来说 这说明沙特领导人对自己和美国政府的关系可能过于自信了 设在迪拜的近东及海湾军事分析研究所 Institute Near East Gulf Military Analysis 首席执行长Riad Kahwaji说 现在还不能说特朗普政府给沙特开了一张空白支票 也不宜过早断言这是沙特取得的一项成就 因为还没有看到特朗普政府在不远的未来实际上会向沙特提供些什么 Yaroslav Trofimov 中国用百亿美元投资挑战美国在巴基斯坦的地位 长久以来 人们总是用三个词来总结巴基斯坦的统治权力结构 那就是真主 Allah 军队 Army 和美国 America 如今 中国正试图利用百亿美元级别的投资取代美国在巴基斯坦的地位 在承诺给巴基斯坦带来经济效益的同时也让巴基斯坦背上巨额债务 进而长期锁定中巴之间的密切关系 在中国致力于对外输出基础设施从而将影响力扩展到亚洲乃至更广泛的地区之际 中国国家主席习近平已将 中巴经济走廊 视为其中一个标杆 到目前为止 巴基斯坦已和中国签署了550亿美元的项目 其中许多项目许诺给中国巨大的投资回报 并给予中国企业税收优惠待遇 前美国总统奥巴马 Barack Obama 的 重返亚洲 战略正在让位于习近平庞大的基建计划 这一模式可能在整个亚洲地区复制并推广 巴基斯坦商务部长Khurram Dastagir说 在没有其他国家愿意投资巴基斯坦的时候 中国来了 而美国错过了机会 中国将 自己的亚洲战略称之为 一带一路 意指复兴古代的海上和陆上丝绸之路 Silk Road 巴基斯坦总理谢里夫 Nawaz Sharif 5月底为 一带一路 在巴基斯坦的第一个大型项目的完成举行了仪式 该项目是位于谢里夫家乡旁遮普省 Punjab 的一座由中国建造的燃煤电厂 中国正在巴基斯坦修建公路 铁路 发电厂和一个港口 并且不到两年时间就向巴基斯坦提供了20亿美元贷款 帮助巴基斯坦补充外汇储备 中国承诺的1万亿美元巨额投资在许多国家还没有兑现 但在巴基斯坦 已经有规模为180亿美元的项目在 中巴经济走廊 框架下投入建设 其中的重点项目是位于巴基斯坦瓜达尔 Gwadar 的阿拉伯海港口 该港口由一家中国公司扩建运营 未来 中国西南部的商品将通过这一港口进行贸易 巴基斯坦估计 通过提供工业化启动所必需的基础设施建设 未来几年中国的投资将为巴基斯坦经济增幅贡献两个百分点 美国总统特朗普 Donald Trump 放弃了被奥巴马用来制衡中国的跨太平洋伙伴关系协定 TPP 美国官员称 虽然美国对其长期盟友巴基斯坦的民用援助依然庞大 但在传达美国的意图方面遇到了挑战 美国独立智库外交关系委员会 Council Foreign Relations 的Ely Ratner表示 不管现实如何 中国正在赢得这场感知游戏 随之而来的将是政治后果 因为人们会发现中国的崛起和影响力是不可避免的 Ratner表示 美国政府在亚洲的战略以军事为主 中国则是用经济利益来捆绑 今年5月 美国国家安全委员会 National Security Council 东亚事务高级主管Matt Pottinger在北京出席 一带一路 庆祝活动时对中国在巴基斯坦的投资计划表示欢迎 但呼吁中国政府确保私营企业能够公平地参与竞争 美国官员表示 这也就是说 应该允许美国企业参与项目竞标 但在巴基斯坦几乎看不到这样的迹象 巴基斯坦政府从中国政府提供的经过筛选的名单中挑选竞标者 而名单中全是中国公司 巴基斯坦官员表示 这是因为中国公司自己会带来项目资金 一位美国官员表示 美国曾要求参与中巴经济走廊 但没有任何进展 正 如美国是通过援助巴基斯坦强大的军队来取得同巴基斯坦的同盟关系 中国也让巴基斯坦军方成为受益者 很多没有授予中国公司的建筑合同都被巴基斯坦军队的工 程部门拿走了 巴基斯坦军方专门组建了一支特种部队来保护中国的工程项目 这支部队现有1 5万人 未来可能扩充一倍 美国国会研究服务部 Congressional Research Service 数据显示 2001年以来 巴基斯坦共获得330亿美元的美国军事和民间援助 但美国的援助并未让美国公司在巴基斯坦赢得任何知名的基础 设施项目 巴基斯坦官员称 巴基斯坦加入美国的反恐战争已导致该国遭受1 230亿美元的经济损失和数万人的死亡 负责监督中国投资的巴基斯坦计划和发展部长伊克巴尔 Ahsan Iqbal 说 巴基斯坦希望从地缘政治转向地缘经济 从战争转向其他方面 他表示 巴基斯坦的愿景是成为本地区的贸易和商务枢纽 中国在巴基斯坦的投资并非援助 交通项目让巴基斯坦背上了债务 建设发电厂的条件是巴基斯坦需要从这些发电厂购买电力 巴 基斯坦反对党统一民族运动党 Muttahida Qaumi

巴基斯坦每年需要向中国支付50亿美元 但随着巴基斯坦出口增加 电价下降 加上中国至瓜达尔的贸易产生的通行费收入 这笔债务应该不难偿还 他说 这些担心只是杞人忧天 Saeed Shah Document WSJCN00020170622ed6m001jl World Wide News World Wide 201 words 22 June 2017 Wall Street Journal
