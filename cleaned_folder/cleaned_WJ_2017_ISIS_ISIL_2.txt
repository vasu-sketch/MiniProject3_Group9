WASHINGTON—ecretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. will work to establish "interim zones of stability" to protect refugees in Syria and Iraq as the international coalition against Islamic State works to retake territory from the extremist group.

Mr. Tillerson, speaking at a conference of the 68-member coalition against Islamic State, held at the State Department on Wednesday, said the coalition would intensify its efforts to confront the extremist group and called on other members to do more as the fight continues.

"The United States will increase our pressure on ISIS and al Qaeda and will work to establish interim zones of stability through cease-fires to allow refugees to return home," Mr. Tillerson said, using an acronym for the group.

The Trump administration has been exploring proposals for establishment of protected areas, sometimes called safe zones, in Syria. The idea has been pushed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but the Pentagon has long opposed the idea of creating heavily guarded zones because of the cost and military commitment required.

There is growing receptiveness among U.S. and international officials to the idea of setting up unofficial Syrian safe zones, which some officials have dubbed "interim de-escalation areas," along Syria's borders with Turkey and Jordan.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who participated in the meeting, said he wasn't sure what Mr. Tillerson meant by "zones of stability," but thought they would cover areas retaken from Islamic State and help people to return to their homes.

A joint statement released at the end of the day's events by the participants included no mention of the zones.

Mr. Ayrault said he pressed Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other U.S. officials on specifics and a timeline for the fight, but the officials told him they need more time. Mr. Mattis told Mr. Ayrault that the campaign to retake Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto Syrian capital, must move quickly but the administration was still figuring out its strategy, Mr. Ayrault said.

"We've been asking for specific answers for a couple of weeks," Mr. Ayrault said. "I wish it went faster."

Mr. Tillerson said the coalition generally would intensify efforts as it moves from military operation to a stabilization phase in the fight against Islamic State, and urged greater intelligence sharing and law-enforcement cooperation as well as renewed focus on confronting the militant group online—fforts that the Obama administration also emphasized. Other than his suggestion of zones of stability, his policy prescriptions mostly tracked the Obama administration's playbook.

"We must increase the intensity of our efforts and solidify our gains," Mr. Tillerson said. "Soon our efforts in Iraq and Syria will enter a new phase."

Mr. Tillerson said the coalition would help to restore water and electricity and to clear land mines. He urged coalition members to contribute more militarily and financially.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi also spoke at the session. Mr. Mattis joined meetings in the afternoon and deputy national security adviser KT McFarland was also present.

Syrian Opposition Monitors Say Coalition Airstrikes Hit School; Coalition says there is ‘o indication' its aircraft struck civilians near Raqqa

BEIRUT—pposition groups that monitor the Syrian conflict said Wednesday that coalition aircraft struck a school this week sheltering the homeless near the militant-held city of Raqqa, leaving at least 33 Syrians dead.

One of the groups, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, described the bombing Monday as a "new massacre committed by the U.S.-led coalition."

The coalition said Wednesday it had "no indication" that its aircraft had hit the civilians. In a statement, it noted that its aircraft routinely strike Islamic State targets near Raqqa, the Sunni Muslim radical group's de facto capital in Syria. It also said it would provide its civilian casualty team with the observatory's information.

The claim of coalition responsibility for the airstrike by the observatory and the antigovernment activist network Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently came as officials of the 68-nation coalition gathered in Washington at the invitation of the Trump administration to discuss strategy to defeat Islamic State.

About 116 civilians have been killed in coalition airstrikes since March 8, the observatory said, as U.S.-backed Kurdish ground forces close in on Raqqa and the coalition's air campaign in the area intensifies.

The observatory's casualty toll couldn't be independently confirmed.

The coalition has been accused of causing civilian casualties before.

Rescue workers and opposition monitoring groups said last week that at least 46 Syrian civilians were killed in a coalition airstrike near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo.

A Pentagon spokesman later confirmed the airstrike on March 16 but said it was unaware of any "credible" reports of civilian casualties.

　【ブリュッセル】米国とベルギーの両政府は、2016年にブリュッセルで発生した連続爆破テロの主要メンバーによる新たな攻撃について警戒を強めている。捜査に関するブリーフィングを受けた関係者が明らかにした。

　2人が犠牲になり重傷者を含む数百人が負傷したブリュッセルの連続爆破テロは、22日で発生から1年となる。節目の日を迎える中で、第二の攻撃に対する懸念の声が上がっているかたちだ。

　捜査関係者はベルギー国籍のウサマ・アタル容疑者（32）が新たな攻撃を仕掛ける動機があるとし、実行グループをまとめるか、自らが犯行に出る手段も手にしている可能性があると話す。アタル容疑者はイラクのアブフレイブ刑務所に収容されていたこともあるが、ベルギー政府などの要請で釈放された過去を持つ。現在はシリアに滞在していると思われ、過激派組織「イスラム国」（IS）に対してシリアで圧力がかかる中で自暴自棄な行動にでる可能性もあると政府関係者は話す。

　ベルギー警察は数カ月にわたり、アタル容疑者の親族の住居を捜査。同容疑者がどのような形でブリュッセルの事件に関わったのかを調べ、新たな攻撃を企てているかを探っている。だが捜査関係者の注目が集まっていることが明らかになれば、焦ったアタル容疑者が何かしらの行動に出る可能性も高まるかもしれないと米政府関係者は話す。

　ベルギー政府は11月にアタル容疑者の資産を凍結。またベルギーおよびフランス政府はここ数カ月の間に同容疑者の逮捕状を発行している。

　欧州や米国の捜査機関は、アタル容疑者がブリュッセルの事件だけでなく2015年11月13日に発生したパリでのテロ事件にも関与したと考えている。パリの事件では130人が犠牲になった。またベルギー側の関係者によれば、ブリュッセルの連続爆破テロ犯が使用していたノートパソコンには、アタル容疑者が攻撃の標的や利用された爆発物の製造方法などについて語っている内容の記録が残っていたという。

　アタル容疑者が「具体的にどのような役割を担ったのかは誰も知らないが、同容疑者は今ではパリとブリュッセルで発生した事件の首謀者の1人だったと考えられている」と、ベルギーを拠点にテロ事件や過激派組織を研究するピーター・ファン・オスタエイェン氏は話す。

　モロッコ系ベルギー人のアタル容疑者は、イラク中西部の都市ラマディにおいてイスラム過激派と共に活動していた疑いで米軍により拘束。アブグレイブ刑務所に収監されていた。その後は多くの収監者と同様にイラク側に身柄を移され、禁錮10年の判決を受けた。だが本人の健康状態を理由にベルギー政府や人権団体から申請を受け、イラク政府はアタル容疑者を2012年に釈放していた。

World News: Iraq: U.S. To Bolster Help in  ISIS  Fight

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. pledged to speed up its support to Iraq in the fight against Islamic State, Iraq's prime minister said following a White House meeting with President Donald Trump.

"We have been given assurances that the support will not only continue but accelerate," Haider al-Abadi said at an event at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a Washington-based think tank, on Monday.

Mr. Abadi spoke shortly after he left a meeting with Mr. Trump and other senior officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, senior presidential adviser Jared Kushner and national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.

His consultations came as the Trump administration is evaluating its approach to confronting Islamic State and other extremist groups in the Middle East and reviewing options that may include sending more troops to help advise local forces. It has already loosened some battlefield rules, including by giving some commanders more authority on the ground.

"We will figure something out. I mean we have to get rid of ISIS. We're going to get rid of ISIS," Mr. Trump said at the start of his meeting with Mr. Abadi.

The White House said after the meeting that the two leaders discussed military cooperation in the fight against Islamic State, also known as Daesh, the Arabic acronym for the extremist group.

"Although ISIS/Da'esh remains a dangerous enemy, we are confident it will be defeated," the White House said in what it described as a joint statement. "As Iraqi forces consolidate gains against ISIS/Da'esh, the two leaders agreed that the United States and Iraq will pursue a long-term partnership to decisively root out terrorism from Iraq and strengthen the Iraqi military and other key institutions."

The officials also discussed strengthening economic ties as Iraq prepares for the end of the campaign against Islamic State and the U.S. said it supported Iraq's efforts to strengthen regional ties.

Mr. Abadi is expected to join a meeting in Washington this week of officials of more than 65 nations in the coalition against the extremist group.

Iraqi government forces, meanwhile, continued to make halting advances against Islamic State in western Mosul, where they are engaged in fierce street fighting in the most complicated section of Iraq's second-largest city.

The fighting has taken a dramatic toll on the civilians.

Mr. Abadi said he hadn't seen the Trump administration's full plan to combat the extremist group in Iraq and Syria, but he was confident its strategy would be effective.

"I know there's a plan," he said. "We have our own plan."

Targeting al Qaeda

The U.S. military confirmed on Friday that it had conducted an airstrike in Syria the day before that targeted al Qaeda militants, but said there was no indication of civilian casualties despite reports from witnesses and on social media that noncombatants had died.

The strike in Al Jinah, about 27 kilometers southwest of Aleppo, targeted a gathering of al Qaeda operatives, some of whom likely were considered high-value targets, said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. He said U.S. officials were unaware of any "credible" reports of civilian casualties.

However, rescue workers, opposition monitoring groups and residents said the airstrike hit a mosque in an opposition-held area, killing at least 46 civilians.

Iraqi government forces have cleared the east and half of western Mosul and are now focused on the Old City.

CMO Today: The Guardian Pulls its Google Ads Over Content Worries; Here's your morning roundup of the biggest marketing, advertising and media industry news and happenings.

GOOFLE: If you follow the online advertising business, you probably wouldn't be shocked to hear about another marketer ending up next to dicey digital content after its ads were placed by an ad tech middleman. But what if Google was involved? The Guardian reported it pulled all of its ads from Google and YouTube because they were found adjacent to extremist content after its agency used Google's programmatic ad exchange. Google responded that it has strict guidelines about where ads should appear and admitted it doesn't always get it right. But the Guardian isn't alone. A month ago, Jaguar yanked its ads after they were spotted on YouTube next to ISIS videos. Even the U.K.

 government has pulled ads from Google. Google's U.K. and Ireland managing director noted in a blog post Friday that while Google last year removed nearly 2 billion bad ads and more than 100,000 publishers from its systems, "we need to do a better job." He also said the company has launched a thorough review of its ad policies, reports Business Insider. If Google can't get this right, who can?

KICKING THE TV HABIT: Marketers worried about the still scruffy nature of digital ads can always stick with TV, right? Not if they want to reach young people, who are much more inclined to consume content on mobile devices, says Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted, who boasted that the brand is planning to ditch TV entirely as it tries to boost e-commerce revenue. "Digital engagement is key for us; you don't see any TV advertising any more," he told CNBC. Sounds bold. Actually, Adidas has run ads in the U.S. this year as part of a campaign featuring Snoop Dogg, reports Business Insider, though the athletic brand still ranked only 511th by analytics firm iSpotTV's count when it came to TV spending over the last month. Mr. Rorsted clearly wanted to talk up his company's innovative, mobile-first strategy while appearing on TV. But there's also the chance this is the beginning of youth-focused marketers seriously rethinking their media budget allocations.

HOME INVASION: It's a tale as old as time. A new medium emerges, consumers adopt it, and then advertisers follow. Is that already happening with those home digital assistants everyone's so excited about? Well, technically, no. Google's voice-controlled Google Home speakers surprised users Thursday with an unprompted voice promotion for Walt Disney Co.'s new live action movie "Beauty and the Beast." But Disney didn't pay for the promotions, which Google says aren't ads, even though they sure sound like them to consumers, reports The Wall Street Journal. One person who heard the promotion called it "jarring" and said advertising on the device "would really ruin the experience." By Thursday afternoon, the movie promotion had been removed. Everyone always says they don't like ads on new devices, at least initially. Google, known for expertly delivering ads people want, has to find a way for promotions on Home devices to be a timely, customized utility for consumers.

MCRIB: Marketing and public relations firms are already preparing strategies for if and when President Donald Trump mentions one of their clients in a tweet. What happens if a brand's own Twitter feed takes on Mr. Trump? That's where McDonald's found itself on Thursday, when its verified corporate account called Mr. Trump a "disgusting excuse for a president" and pined for the return of Barack Obama, reports Vice News. The tweet was deleted 19 minutes later. Did somebody go rogue at Mickey D's? Nope. According to McDonald's, the account was hacked, reports WSJ and Adweek. A brief effort on Twitter to boycott the fast-food chain fizzled quickly, but it remains to be seen if the brand will take any sort of long-term hit. Some may find the security incident on Twitter disconcerting, especially given how often the platform is used by a certain leader of the free world.

U.S. News: Funds Sought for Military,  ISIS  Fight

WASHINGTON -- The White House is seeking $30 billion in added funding this year for the military and its campaign against Islamic State, in addition to the $54 billion in new defense spending it wants for next fiscal year.

The Trump administration, in a supplemental budget request to Congress released Thursday, also seeks $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, to be used for border security -- including $1.4 billion to begin work on the administration's proposed wall along the southern border.

The administration released two budget outlines Thursday: one for the remainder of fiscal 2017 and one for the 2018 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1.

Under the $30 billion supplemental request for 2017, the military budget would grow by $24.9 billion to address what the administration calls "critical budget shortfalls," including in manpower and munitions. The request also includes $5.1 billion in contingency spending to support operations aimed at defeating Islamic State and assisting the government of Afghanistan in its campaign against the Taliban.

The administration asks Congress to make $18 billion in cuts from the nondefense discretionary budget this year. That amount fully offsets the proposed increases in homeland-security funding and half of the increase in military funding, the White House said.

Aiming to balance increases in military spending with requests to cut domestic programs mirrors the administration's approach to the 2018 federal budget. The Trump administration is asking Congress for a $54 billion increase in spending on defense-related programs, with corresponding cuts to nonmilitary agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Health and Human Services.

The White House says the additional Pentagon funding would help develop "a comprehensive, whole-of-Government strategy to stop ISIS from posing a threat to the United States by funding critical efforts to strike ISIS targets, support our partners fighting on the ground, disrupt ISIS's external operations, and cut off its flows of financing."

Included in the increase to the base Pentagon budget is $13.5 billion for procurement of military equipment, including jet fighters, helicopters, missiles and air-defense systems. The supplemental request also would provide the remainder of the funding for a DDG-51 destroyer, for which Congress provided only partial funding in 2016, the administration said.

An additional $7.2 billion would go toward plugging gaps in military readiness and to support cyberwar and intelligence operations. The White House is weighing in on the final months of 2017 in part because Congress still hasn't finished appropriations -- current spending legislation funds the government only through April 28.

World News -- Middle East Crossroads: Iraq Faces Balancing Act Between the U.S. and Iran

By Yaroslav Trofimov

MOSUL, Iraq -- In the battle against Islamic State, the U.S. and Iran have become de facto allies in Iraq, a convergence of interests that permitted both nations to tacitly cooperate and avoid open conflicts.

Once Islamic State is defeated, however, Washington's and Tehran's interests are likely to diverge, especially if President Donald Trump makes good on his pledge to aggressively contain Iranian power in the region.

To many Iraqis, this poses a challenge: Will their country, just as it emerges from the devastating war against Islamic State, get sucked into in a new round of rivalry between its two most important partners? Such a conflict in Iraq, after all, has the potential to reverberate across the Middle East -- and to set off a new wave of bloodshed.

"Iraq has a divided loyalty -- between the Unites States and Iran -- and it has to find its balance," Hoshyar Zebari, a senior Kurdish politician who served as Iraq's foreign minister for more than a decade, explained the dilemma.

Iran exercises strong influence over Iraq's central government in Baghdad, where key ministries are occupied by pro-Iranian politicians, and even more so over the Shiite armed groups that gained prominence after Islamic State conquered most of the country's Sunni areas in the summer of 2014.

"Iran has 100% control," argued Hamid al Mutlaq, a parliament member from the Sunni province of Anbar. "America gave Iraq to Iran as an easy gift, and of course Iran wants to exploit this situation. If America is honest in correcting its mistakes, there should be a clash between its interests and those of Iran."

Tehran also enjoys considerable sway in the self-ruled Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, particularly in its eastern half. Renewed friction between Washington and Tehran could be just as destabilizing for Kurdistan.

While American influence in Iraq waned after the Obama administration pulled out U.S. forces in 2011, the rapid advances of Islamic State in 2014 forced Washington to play an increasingly critical role in the country.

After the rout of the Iraqi military that year, combined pressure from Washington and Tehran led the Iraqi parliament to oust Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, seen in both capitals as responsible for the debacle, and to replace him with current Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.

Since then, the U.S. sent some 5,000 troops to Iraq and waged an air campaign that helped Iraq regain most of the territories lost in 2014. In recent months, Iraqi troops reclaimed from Islamic State roughly three-quarters of the northern metropolis of Mosul.

"At the moment, the common enemy has made tensions between the U.S. and Iran inapparent," said Dlawer Ala'Aldeen, president of the Middle East Research Institute in Kurdistan's regional capital Erbil. "But they will become more visible after the defeat of ISIS."

Mr. Trump complained in a tweet last month that "Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq" and, according to a White House readout of his call with Mr. Abadi days later, raised with the Iraqi leader "the threat Iran presents across the entire region." Mr. Trump and Mr. Abadi also reaffirmed the "strong" military partnership between Washington and Baghdad.

Whether U.S. forces remain in Iraq after the fall of Mosul, is likely to emerge as an early political flashpoint -- especially once Iraq gears up for national elections next year.

"Today we have two enemies, the ISIS enemy and the American enemy. If ISIS gets defeated militarily there won't be any justification for the presence of American forces, and we will treat them as invaders, just as we did between 2003 and 2011," said Sheik Abu Talib al Sa'aidi, a senior leader of one of the main pro-Iranian Shiite militias, Kataeb Hezbollah, which fought against U.S. troops before the 2011 pullout.

It's unclear -- and will depend on the broader course of the U.S.-Iranian relationship -- to what extent such fiery rhetoric will reflect Tehran's actual policies.

Hassan Ahmadian, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic Research think tank in Tehran, said that, for now, there is little potential for a clash between the U.S. and Iran over Iraq.

"The main stake for both countries will be stability in Iraq," Mr. Ahmadian said. "The primary goal for Iran is to keep Iraq intact, and I don't think this conflicts with the primary goal of the U.S., which is also stability in Iraq."

Can Americans Trust Their Spies?

The spy world is cloaked in secrecy, but last week's leak of documents from the Central Intelligence Agency offers a tiny glimpse into what America's operatives can do. It seems the CIA can hack smart televisions to listen in on conversations, even when the set appears to be off. Smartphones might be less secure than many assumed. The CIA can supposedly penetrate a computer network and leave fingerprints implicating someone else. Man, these guys are good!

Personally, I'm thrilled to hear that the CIA has developed these capabilities. Stealing information from other countries is what spies do. But it's devastating to see details about America's intelligence operations leaked to the press. These kinds of intrusions recently have compromised billions of dollars worth of sources and methods, showing the world -- including Islamic State and al Qaeda -- how Washington knows what it does. They have also caused Americans to ask serious questions about their spy agencies.

The leaks by Chelsea (nee Bradley) Manning in 2010, Edward Snowden in 2013, and now at the CIA demonstrate that the intelligence community does not have in place the systems and controls necessary to protect its most sensitive information. That raises the question of whether spy agencies can credibly say that these capabilities are not used against the American people.

The intelligence community can explain what the law says and even cite internal policies that exist to inhibit spying on Americans. But a spy agency that is incapable of keeping its secrets cannot say with confidence that it has effective means of controlling itself. When James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, says America does not spy on its citizens, he doesn't really know. He hopes that the internal controls and culture will prevent abuse, but he cannot be certain.

After the Manning leak, I'm sure that America's spymasters thought they had learned their lesson and put in place new, more effective controls. After the Snowden leak, I'm sure they thought those controls had been updated enough to solve the problem. Yet here we are, reading about the CIA's secrets on the front page of the newspaper.

In 2013 Mr. Clapper testified in an open congressional hearing that the intelligence community did not maintain a cyberdatabase on Americans. That wasn't true. He misled Congress and the public. The Snowden leak soon showed that the NSA did indeed have a massive database of telephone metadata.

Now the intelligence community has been implicated in the release of information damaging to the incoming president. Telephone conversations involving Mike Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump's national security adviser, were collected and leaked to the media.

For 10 years I served on the House Intelligence Committee, and the men and women I met from America's spy agencies were dedicated, hardworking and committed to serving their country. But these episodes indicate that at least a few within that cadre are willing to risk the security of the U.S. for what they must see as some higher purpose. In the process, they betray their oath and tarnish the reputations of their organizations.

This has helped create a second credibility problem for the intelligence community. The public worries that America's cyberwarfare capabilities may be falling behind. For the past 75 years the U.S. has been blessed with a military that is second to none, with technology to match -- from smart bombs and cruise missiles to stealthy submarines and antimissile defenses. America dominates the traditional battlefield.

But the cyber battlefield is very different. There the U.S. faces the usual threats and then some. Russia and China are good in cyberspace, and so are the Iranians and Israelis. Does America retain any discernible edge over North Korea or nonstate actors like ISIS or criminal cartels? If so, how great is it?

These are important questions. Cyberspace may become the great equalizer in modern warfare, allowing lesser countries and organizations to pose the kind of threat they never could on the traditional battlefield. Many experts believe that America is dangerously vulnerable. Could a foreign enemy cripple the financial system, shut down part of the electrical grid, or even cause a meltdown at a nuclear power plant?

Just as Americans deserve to know their government is not spying on them, they need assurance that the U.S. is capable of winning wars in cyberspace and protecting the country's critical infrastructure. On both points, the intelligence community faces a credibility gap.

That is the challenge for the new director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, and the CIA director, Mike Pompeo. In addition to keeping the nation secure, they need to restore trust between America's spies and its citizens. A good first step would be teaching intelligence agencies to keep their own secrets -- so that Americans must once again merely imagine what their spies can do.

Foreign  ISIS  Fighters Increasingly Isolated in Mosul Battle; Local militants are fleeing as the extremist group loses ground in its last major Iraqi stronghold

MOSUL, Iraq—slamic State fighters from outside Iraq are increasingly being abandoned by local militants as the group loses ground in Mosul, leaving a hardened core of extremists dominated by foreigners that is girding for a fight to the finish.

Teams of up to 10 fighters composed mainly of foreigners control individual streets in the group's last major Iraqi stronghold, using rooftops as sniper positions and outfitting vehicles with explosives, residents said. The fighters are also building tunnels inside private homes and using residents as human shields, Iraqi and American commanders say.

Unlike militants from Mosul, many foreign fighters and Iraqis from other parts of the country are unable to quit and blend in with civilians who are fleeing the city by the thousands. And with Mosul basically surrounded by Iraqi forces, foreigners can't easily escape into the desert region bordering Syria, either.

"This is their last stand," said Lt. Gen. Abdelghani al-Assadi, the commander of Iraq's elite U.S.-trained counterterrorism forces. "99% of them came to die."

In some cases, the foreign fighters have executed Iraqi militants as Islamic State suffers setbacks and tensions rise, said Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting the group in Iraq and Syria. "It works very well for us because it saves our partner force the trouble of fighting them," he said.

Between 1,500 and 2,000 Islamic State fighters remain in western Mosul, with 70% to 90% of them hailing from outside Iraq—rimarily Saudi Arabia, Yemen, China, Tajikistan and Russia, including the Chechnya region—op officers in the counterterrorism forces estimate.

Many of the foreigners commanded militant units in eastern Mosul, but managed to flee across the Tigris River when that part of the city was recaptured by government forces in late January. Now the militants have nowhere to go, and the battle for western Mosul has become particularly destructive.

The limited ability to shuttle foreign militants between Iraq and Syria will deprive Islamic State of its fiercest fighters when the group faces a life or death battle for the Syrian city of Raqqa, de facto capital of its self-declared caliphate, the officers said. Syrian rebels, the Assad regime and Kurdish-led militias are fighting for position around Raqqa, as debates over strategy in Washington threaten to delay an offensive there until at least next month.

American commanders assisting the Iraqi military said the fight in western Mosul has highlighted an Islamic State command structure that tilts heavily toward foreigners and shows that Islamic State's remaining influence in Iraq is waning.

Over the past several months, the gap between Iraqi and foreign militants has grown, with the foreigners enjoying better pay and treatment and getting better weapons, said Maj. Gen. Joseph Martin, the commander of American ground forces in Iraq.

"They are subjugating the population and their native Iraqi fighters as well," he said.

Iraq's military said it has won back three-fourths of western Mosul since launching a ground offensive there on Feb. 19—ains that have come partly because frustrated Iraqi fighters are abandoning the battle.

Iraqi authorities are carefully inspecting people escaping the city and arresting suspected militants among them, which could guard against those militants returning to the insurgency. Many of the Iraqis arrested are believed to be Mosul natives who were forced to fight alongside Islamic State, according to Iraqi military commanders. Iraqi fighters who have remained are often from other parts of the country and cannot easily escape undetected.

Those gains have come at a high cost to civilians in western Mosul's older, more densely populated neighborhoods. Airwars, an independent research group monitoring civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria, estimated between 250 to 370 civilians were killed in the first week of March, due partly to Iraqi and coalition airstrikes and artillery. The United Nations has also reported high civilian casualty rates, citing Islamic State's indiscriminate shelling as a major contributor.

Residents of western Mosul are often warier of Iraqi security forces, having lived under militant influence since 2004, when al Qaeda, a predecessor to Islamic State in Iraq, planted roots in that part of the city.

Lt. Gen. Abdelwahab al-Saaidi, an Iraqi counterterrorism commander, said residents in western Mosul have been stingy on sharing information on militant positions.

Since Islamic State seized the city in June 2014, the group has used the spoils of Mosul to lure foreigners.

Fighters and administrators from Europe and the Persian Gulf moved into the city's well-heeled districts that were home to spacious villas abandoned by doctors and professors, residents said. Soon Russian, French and Dutch could be heard alongside Arabic in the public markets dotting the tony districts along the Tigris's eastern bank, residents of eastern Mosul said. With such preferential treatment and no clear route for escape, they were trusted not to defect.

"Locals could escape the fight and disappear with the help of relatives," said a senior Iraqi field officer. "But the foreign fighters stayed because they have no other place to go."

Those who remain have worked to fortify the city's defenses.

Engineers have outfitted store-bought drones with explosives, and they have also modified and repaired weapons, said the senior Iraqi officer.

Hisham al-Hashimi, a terrorism researcher who has advised the Iraqi government, said Chinese fighters with mining backgrounds have been valuable to Islamic State for their experience in digging tunnels that militants use to move discreetly and ambush Iraqi troops.

Sommoud, a neighborhood along a thoroughfare in western Mosul called Baghdad Road, bears scars of fierce battles being led by foreigners.

Residents and Iraqi commanders said Islamic State had in late February sent extra fortification to Sommoud as a first line of defense against advancing Iraqi troops.

Ten militants appeared on a residential street, commanded by a Saudi Arabian fighter who told locals to call him Abu Layla. He had two deputies, residents said, a Sudanese and a Yemeni easily identified by their accents.

The three men ordered Iraqi fighters under their command, along with young men who lived on the street, to use sledgehammers to make holes in the walls between houses so they could move between them undetected by Iraqi and coalition forces, residents said.

"The Saudi fighter gave the orders to the Iraqi fighters," said Tariq Humoud, a 60-year-old resident on the block.

Abu Layla also ordered that all cars without working batteries on the street be torched as they couldn't be used as car bombs, Mr. Humoud said.

The street had been the site of a late February battle led by Abu Layla's unit, residents said. After six days, their homes were in ruins.

"They were criminals," said resident Faris Muhammad, 49. "They destroyed lives and homes for the sake of destruction. The Saudi in particular terrorized us."

Trump Seeks $30 Billion More This Year for Military and Fight Against Islamic State; The president's request comes in addition to the $54 billion in new military spending he wants for next fiscal year

WASHINGTON—he White House is seeking $30 billion in added funding this year for the military and its campaign against Islamic State. That comes in addition to the $54 billion in new military spending it wants for next fiscal year.

The Trump administration, in a supplemental budget request to Congress released Thursday, also seeks $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, to be used for border security—ncluding $1.4 billion to begin work on the administration's proposed wall along the southern border.

The Trump administration released two separate budget outlines on Thursday: one for the remainder of fiscal 2017 and one for the 2018 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1.

Under the $30 billion supplemental request for 2017, the military budget would grow by $24.9 billion to address what the administration calls "critical budget shortfalls," including in manpower and munitions. The request also includes $5.1 billion in contingency spending to support operations aimed at defeating Islamic State and assisting the government of Afghanistan in its ongoing campaign against the Taliban.

The administration asks Congress to make $18 billion in cuts from the nondefense discretionary budget this year. That amount fully offsets the proposed increases in homeland security funding, and offsets half of the increase in funding for the military, the White House said.

That approach—iming to balance increases in military spending with requests to cut domestic programs—irrors the approach of the administration's blueprint for the 2018 federal budget, also released Thursday. The Trump administration is asking Congress for a $54 billion increase in spending on defense-related programs, with a corresponding wave of cuts to nonmilitary agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Health and Human Services.

In its request to Congress, the White House says that the additional Pentagon funding will help develop "a comprehensive, whole-of-Government strategy to stop ISIS from posing a threat to the United States by funding critical efforts to strike ISIS targets, support our partners fighting on the ground, disrupt ISIS's external operations, and cut off its flows of financing."

Included in the increase to the base Pentagon budget is $13.5 billion for procurement of military equipment, including jet fighters, helicopters, missiles and air defense systems. The supplemental request would also provide the remainder of the funding for a DDG-51 destroyer, for which Congress provided only partial funding in 2016, the administration said.

An additional $7.2 billion would go toward plugging gaps in military readiness, including for training, and to support cyberwar and intelligence operations.

The White House is weighing in on the final months of 2017 in part because Congress still hasn't finished appropriations—urrent spending legislation funds the government only through April 28.

Lawmakers passed that short-term measure in December after a protracted fight in the Senate, offering a small preview of battles expected to take place under Mr. Trump.

How Algorithms Can Help Beat Islamic State; Hany Farid ‘hanged the world' by combating child porn. Now his software could suppress terrorists online.

Hanover, N.H.

You can't blame the message on the medium, not exactly. But maybe, all things considered, arming everyone with pocket supercomputers, and then filtering most of human experience through social-media feedback loops, wasn't the greatest idea.

America recently endured the most electronic and media-saturated presidential campaign in memory, with its hacks, private servers, secret videotapes, fake news, troll armies and hour-by-hour internet outrage across all platforms. And however glorious modern communications may be, they've also empowered a cast of goons, crooks and jihadists to build audiences and influence world-wide.

A technological solution, at least to that last problem, may lie 2,600 miles east of Silicon Valley, in a computer-science laboratory at Dartmouth College. Prof. Hany Farid, chairman of the department, creates algorithms that can sweep digital networks and automatically purge extremist content—f only the tech companies will adopt them.

"If you look at recent attacks, from Orlando to San Bernardino to Nice to Paris to Brussels," Mr. Farid says, "all of those attackers had been radicalized online. They weren't going to Syria. They watched YouTube videos."

He continues: "The dark side of the open internet is that truly fringe and harmful ideas now are mainstream, or at least accessible to 7½illion people." Yet "whenever we have one of these attacks, we just wring our hands for a few weeks and then wait for the next one to happen."

Social networks have created "a new environment for radicalization and recruitment," says David Ibsen, executive director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization to which Mr. Farid is a senior adviser. Terror groups weaponize Twitter, Google, Facebook and other forums to plan or encourage violence; to discover the vulnerable or disaffected; and to publish professional, sophisticated and carefully presented propaganda.

Islamic State is basically a digital-first media startup. (By comparison, al Qaeda was MySpace.) ISIS content is beamed out globally and becomes refractory across the viral web. Some videos show vignettes of ISIS bureaucrats delivering social services or its fighters talking about the battle between belief and unbelief. Others are more savage—eheadings, stonings, drownings, other torture and combat operations.

Mr. Farid slipped into this world slant-wise. He's a founder of the computer-science field known as digital forensics. In the late 1990s as a postdoctoral researcher, he was among the first to recognize that mathematical and computational techniques to authenticate digital images and other media would be useful to society.

Because images so powerfully change what we are willing to believe, the modern era requires a scientific method to ensure we can trust them. How can we prove, for example, that digital photographs aren't forgeries so they are admissible as evidence in court? Images are increasingly important in cellular, molecular and neurological medicine, Mr. Farid notes, and tampering has led to more than one research-and-retraction scandal. Unscrupulous stringers sometimes file doctored photos with news organizations, and unscrupulous motorists sometimes photoshop pictures to exaggerate fender-benders for insurance claims.

Mr. Farid explains how image authentication works: "We think about how light interacts in the physical world; what happens when that light hits the front of the lens and gets focused and goes through an optical train; what happens when that light hits an electronic sensor and gets converted from an analog to a digital and then goes through a postprocessing and gets saved as .jpeg and then gets posted on Facebook." By identifying "statistical and geometrical and physical regularities" in this life cycle, software can search for inconsistencies to expose manipulation.

In 2008 this research pulled Mr. Farid into another underworld—hild pornography. In 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a ban on "virtual" child porn—omputer-generated images that "appear to depict minors but were produced without using any real children." Mr. Farid is sometimes brought in as an outside expert when a defendant claims the material at issue is virtual.

The child-porn industry was nearly defunct by the 1990s, because negatives and videotapes can be confiscated and destroyed. "Then the internet came," Mr. Farid says, "and all hell broke loose."

Supply can create its own demand. Much like jihadists, deviants formed a global community, finding each other online and sharing what are really crime-scene photos. Like ISIS agitprop, material is continuously copied, cut, spliced, resized, recompressed and otherwise changed, in part to evade detection as it is retransmitted again and again.

Mr. Farid worked with Microsoft to solve both problems—etection and replication. He coded a tool called Photo DNA that uses "robust hashing" to sweep for child porn. "The hashing part is that you reach into a digital image and extract a unique signature. The robust part is if that image undergoes simple changes, the fingerprint shouldn't change. When you change your clothes, cut your hair, as you age, your DNA stays constant," he says. "That's what you want from this distinct fingerprint."

The algorithm matches against a registry of known illegal signatures, or hashes, to find and delete photographs, audio and video. Photo DNA is engineered to work at "internet scale," says Mr. Farid, meaning it can process billions of uploads a day in microseconds with a low false-positive rate and little human intervention.

Monitoring by Photo DNA, which is licensed by Microsoft at no cost and now used in most networks, revealed that the nature of the problem was "not what we thought it was," says Ernie Allen, the retired head of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Child pornography was far more widely circulated than law enforcement believed. "Hany Farid changed the world," Mr. Allen adds. "His innovation rescued or touched the lives of thousand of kids, and uncovered perpetrators, and prevented terrible revictimization as content was constantly redistributed."

Mr. Farid linked up with the Counter Extremism Project to apply the same robust-hashing method to extremist propaganda. But this effort has encountered resistance. "The pushback from the tech companies has been pretty strong," the project's Mr. Ibsen says dryly.

U.S. law immunizes internet companies from criminal and civil liability for content that travels over their transoms. Their terms of service forbid abusive content, but they rely on users instead of algorithms to police violations. "It's a very slow and tedious process: You wait for it to get reported, somebody has to review it, they make mistakes," Mr. Farid says. "They take down the Vietnam napalm girl on Facebook."

Liability aside, what about their moral obligations to help prevent death, injury and destruction? "In my mind, we're not asking them even to do something that they haven't said they want to do already. We're saying, hey, would you please do the thing that you promised you would do?" he explains. "I am simply saying, look, for free, you can automate this and make it really efficient and really fast and save you money on the side."

But the "ethos" of Silicon Valley doesn't include becoming the censors of the internet, and tech firms fear a slippery slope. "The concern they have is, OK, first they came for the child porn, then they came for the extremism, next they're going to take the kitten videos," Mr. Farid says. "I think that's a bit of a hysterical leap. We are talking about content with very clear and well-defined harm. These are not abstract notions—‘ don't want people to be mean to me.' We're not talking about bullying. We are talking about things with very immediate consequences and very real harm."

One question is how to distinguish support for terrorism from the merely inappropriate or objectionable. What about Islamic State's black-flag brand, or a declaration of a caliphate, or the sermons of Anwar al-Awlaki? Maybe you know it when you see it.

"Is an ISIS fighter saying ‘eath to the West' extremism? I don't know. I don't want to have that conversation," Mr. Farid replies. "I'm talking about explicit acts of violence, explicit calls to violence, explicit glorification of violence, depravity, the worst of the worst of the worst."

His point is that tech companies can make judgment calls about the middle ground, wherever it might be, for themselves: "You decide: Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, and then we'll build a cache and eliminate that content from your networks."

Mr. Farid concedes that there are dangers: "This type of technology is agnostic in what it's looking for. It can be used in ways we would not approve of, such as stifling speech. You can't deny that. This is what we've learned about technology over the years—t can be used for good and for bad. Social media platforms can be good and bad."

There has been some progress. Twitter has deleted hundreds of thousands of handles associated with terrorism since 2015, and late last year Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft and YouTube announced an industry antiterror consortium. But Mr. Farid's robust hashing remains a hard sell.

The irony is that algorithms increasingly govern the world. Networks are perpetually scanned for spam, malware, viruses; Google reads your email to target ads; credit-card companies monitor your financial transactions to prevent fraud. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg even promises to use algorithms to distinguish truth from falsehood. As a scholar of the differences between the two, Mr. Farid has a few thoughts.

In the backwash of 2016, Mr. Zuckerberg published a 5,800-word manifesto that promised Facebook's artificial intelligence would soon learn to sort real news from hoaxes and misinformation, break up "filter bubbles," and draw a line between free speech and suborning terror. The goal, he wrote, is to preserve "our shared sense of reality."

Mr. Farid is a skeptic: "As somebody who worked for a long time in this space, I think he's underestimating what a hard problem this is." Mr. Zuckerberg "paints this picture like machine learning is going to be fully automatic—asically you'll be able to set criteria on your page, ‘ don't want to see violence, I don't want to see bad words,' and it'll just work.

"Even as a technologist, and despite all the advance of technology, the human brain is astonishing at what it does. Our ability to make these types of assessments that are really hard for these AI algorithms is humbling. I don't think we'll get it in the next five or 10 years."

Meantime, Mr. Farid has developed a technology that could work today to contain a growing threat. While we await the Facebook utopia, perhaps our digital lives—nd our real lives—ould be healthier if it were widely deployed.

A New Strategy Against  ISIS  and al Qaeda

By Frederick Kagan and Kimberly Kagan

The Trump administration is set to supersize President Obama's strategy to defeat Islamic State, sending more U.S. forces to the region and lifting restraints on direct participation in combat and when to use armed force. Yet any victory under the current approach will be ephemeral. Even if American proxies, backed by U.S. military forces, wrest Raqqa, Syria, and Mosul, Iraq, away from Islamic State, success will be fleeting.

The most important error is the near-exclusive focus on Islamic State at the expense of serious efforts against al Qaeda. Destroying Islamic State is necessary but not sufficient. As the Obama administration turned its attention toward Islamic State, al Qaeda learned from its failures. It has temporarily deprioritized spectacular attacks on the global stage and focused on embedding itself within Sunni communities in Syria, Yemen, North Africa and elsewhere to develop long-term strength and resilience.

Al Qaeda also has become more cautious in imposing its radical version of Shariah. It now indoctrinates populations over years rather than forcing immediate compliance with strict Islamic law. It doesn't demand that fighters place themselves formally and publicly under its command. Its affiliates in Syria don't even insist that local groups accept its ideology as long as they fight common foes. Al Qaeda today introduces its beliefs slowly and carefully, and the false message that it is more moderate than Islamic State resonates around the world.

The second major flaw in America's strategy against Islamic State, which is Sunni, is Washington's reliance on non-Sunni and non-Arab partners. That amplifies the terror group's message. In Iraq the U.S. works with the Shiite-dominated government, whose past persecution of Sunni Arabs fueled Islamic State's rise. Meanwhile, America's Kurdish partners in both Iraq and Syria are pursuing an independent Kurdistan, a political goal that is unacceptable to most Arabs.

The U.S. has no meaningful presence among the Sunni Arab tribes in Iraq and Syria that Islamic State, al Qaeda and others are vying to control. This appears to confirm al Qaeda's claim that it is the only effective armed force dedicated to protecting Sunni populations from a combined assault by all the world's powers. That message may win out if Washington doesn't rapidly change its approach.

The current strategy also empowers Iran and Russia, which have done little to fight Islamic State. Instead they have focused on destroying the moderate Syrian opposition that threatened the regime of Bashar Assad. Iran and Russia made great progress toward that aim in December when they helped forces loyal to Mr. Assad seize Aleppo.

The U.S. has done nothing to limit Iran's increased military activity in Syria or Iraq. Tehran has sent ground forces from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to fight in Syria. It has also recruited thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis, deployed fighters from Lebanese Hezbollah, and brought in Iraqi Shiite militiamen. Iran has penetrated Syria so thoroughly that if it withdrew the Assad regime couldn't survive. Unless the U.S. acts soon, Tehran's expanded military presence will become permanent.

America's backing of Kurdish-led forces to take Raqqa exacerbates these problems and offers little gain. Its capture won't shatter Islamic State, which retains control of southeastern Syria, from the city of Deir ez Zour to the Iraqi border. Raqqa's fall will represent only a tactical victory -- and al Qaeda, Iran, the Assad regime and the Kurds will compete for the spoils. Sunnis will lose, diminishing the chance of forging a strong Sunni leadership opposed to Islamic State and al Qaeda.

What's needed is a new approach -- and we have one. The Institute for the Study of War joined with the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute for an intensive planning exercise beginning in November 2015. Our analysts tested more than 15 different courses of action before arriving at the one that offers the best chance of changing the momentum in Syria.

The key is finding new Sunni partners and taking the fight to new terrain, specifically, southeastern Syria, where Islamic State leaders have refuge. American military forces will be necessary. But the U.S. can recruit new Sunni Arab partners by fighting alongside them in their land. The goal in the beginning must be against Islamic State because it controls the last areas in Syria where the U.S. can reasonably hope to find Sunni allies not yet under the influence of al Qaeda. But the aim after evicting Islamic State must be to raise a Sunni Arab army that can ultimately defeat al Qaeda and help negotiate a settlement to the war.

The U.S. will have to pressure the Assad regime, Iran and Russia to end the conflict on terms that the Sunni Arabs will accept. That will be easier to do with the independence and leverage of a secure base inside Syria. America should also liberate itself from the troublesome reliance on Turkey by shifting its base of operations south, where a reliable ally, Jordan, is fully committed to fighting Salafi jihadism. Both these moves would give Washington access to Sunni partners not heavily infiltrated by al Qaeda.

No single military operation can achieve victory in Syria. But an operation against the enemy's heartland, freed of the constraints imposed by problematic proxies, would change the assumptions of America's friends and enemies. President Trump should break through the flawed logic and poor planning that he inherited from his predecessor. He can transform this struggle, but only by transforming America's approach.

A New Strategy Against  ISIS  and al Qaeda

The Trump administration is set to supersize President Obama's strategy to defeat Islamic State, sending more American forces to the region and lifting restraints on direct participation in combat and when to use armed force. Yet any victory under the current approach will be ephemeral. Even if American proxies, backed by U.S. military forces, wrest Raqqa, Syria, and Mosul, Iraq, away from ISIS, success will be fleeting.

The most important error is the near-exclusive focus on Islamic State at the expense of serious efforts against al Qaeda. Destroying ISIS is necessary but not sufficient. As the Obama administration turned its attention toward ISIS, al Qaeda learned from its failures. It has temporarily deprioritized spectacular attacks on the global stage and focused on embedding itself within Sunni communities in Syria, Yemen, North Africa and elsewhere to develop long-term strength and resilience.

Al Qaeda also has become more cautious in imposing its radical version of Shariah. It now indoctrinates populations over years rather than forcing immediate compliance with strict Islamic law. It does not demand that fighters place themselves formally and publicly under its command. Its affiliates in Syria do not even insist that local groups accept its ideology as long as they fight common foes. Al Qaeda today introduces its beliefs slowly and carefully, and the false message that it is more moderate than ISIS resonates around the world.

The second major flaw in America's strategy against ISIS, which is Sunni, is Washington's reliance on non-Sunni and non-Arab partners. That amplifies the terror group's message. In Iraq the U.S. works with the Shiite-dominated government, whose past persecution of Sunni Arabs fueled ISIS's rise. Meanwhile, America's Kurdish partners in both Iraq and Syria are pursuing an independent Kurdistan, a political goal that is unacceptable to most Arabs.

The U.S. has no meaningful presence among the Sunni Arab tribes in Iraq and Syria that ISIS, al Qaeda and others are vying to control. This appears to confirm al Qaeda's claim that it is the only effective armed force dedicated to protecting Sunni populations from a combined assault by all the world's powers. That message may win out if Washington does not rapidly change its approach.

The current strategy also empowers Iran and Russia, which have done little to fight ISIS. Instead they have focused on destroying the moderate Syrian opposition that threatened the regime of Bashar Assad. Iran and Russia made great progress toward that aim in December when they helped forces loyal to Mr. Assad seize Aleppo.

The U.S. has done nothing to limit Iran's increased military activity in Syria or Iraq. Tehran has sent ground forces from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to fight in Syria. It has also recruited thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis, deployed fighters from Lebanese Hezbollah, and brought in Iraqi Shiite militiamen. Iran has penetrated Syria so thoroughly that if it withdrew the Assad regime could not survive. Unless the U.S. acts soon, Tehran's expanded military presence will become permanent.

America's backing of Kurdish-led forces to take Raqqa exacerbates these problems and offers little gain. Its capture will not shatter ISIS, which retains control of southeastern Syria, from the city of Deir ez Zour to the Iraqi border. Raqqa's fall will represent only a tactical victory -- and al Qaeda, Iran, the Assad regime and the Kurds will compete for the spoils. Sunnis will lose, diminishing the chance of forging a strong Sunni leadership opposed to ISIS and al Qaeda.

What's needed is a new approach -- and we have one. The Institute for the Study of War joined with the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute for an intensive planning exercise beginning in November 2015. Our analysts tested more than 15 different courses of action before arriving at the one that offers the best chance of changing the momentum in Syria.

The key is finding new Sunni partners and taking the fight to new terrain, specifically, southeastern Syria, where ISIS leaders have refuge. American military forces will be necessary. But the U.S. can recruit new Sunni Arab partners by fighting alongside them in their land. The goal in the beginning must be against ISIS because it controls the last areas in Syria where the U.S. can reasonably hope to find Sunni allies not yet under the influence of al Qaeda. But the aim after evicting ISIS must be to raise a Sunni Arab army that can ultimately defeat al Qaeda and help negotiate a settlement to the war.

The U.S. will have to pressure the Assad regime, Iran and Russia to end the conflict on terms that the Sunni Arabs will accept. That will be easier to do with the independence and leverage of a secure base inside Syria. America should also liberate itself from the troublesome reliance on Turkey by shifting its base of operations south, where a reliable ally, Jordan, is fully committed to fighting Salafi jihadism. Both these moves would give Washington access to Sunni partners not heavily infiltrated by al Qaeda.

No single military operation can achieve victory in Syria. But an operation against the enemy's heartland, freed of the constraints imposed by problematic proxies, would change the assumptions of America's friends and enemies. President Trump should break through the flawed logic and poor planning that he inherited from his predecessor. He can transform this struggle, but only by transforming America's approach to it.

Repeal and Replace; A transcript of the weekend's program on FOX News Channel.

David Asman: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm David Asman, in this week for Paul Gigot.

Two key House committees approved the GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act late this week. It will be the bill's first victory after a very rocky rollout. The White House promising a, quote, "full- court press" to push the plan forward amid a backlash from some conservative lawmakers over what should replace Obamacare.

Sen. Rand Paul : We have to admit that we are divided on replacement. We are united on repeal but we are divided on replacement.

Asman: Joining the penal this week. "Wall Street Journal" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Washington columnist, Kim Strassel; editorial board member, Joe Rago; and columnist, Bill McGurn.

Kim, you spent a lot of time talking to conservatives who oppose this bill this week. What is their view?

Kim Strassel: So here is the good news, David, that the leadership is actually moving ahead with both repeal and replace. The problem is they erred on the side of being very generous to some of their more Senate modernists and centrists with a couple of provisions, particularly on Medicaid, some tax questions. Conservatives are unhappy about those proposals. They feel as though the Medicaid expansion goes on too long, that they should have cut the Cadillac tax that was kept. So there's a series of negotiations going on. I think the good news is that those negotiations are happening. And they may end in a place where everybody can say yes.

Asman: Dan, President Trump says the dispute is overblown by the media, that he is going to make a deal, that he's invited them to these bowling parties. There is one this week and one next week. Is there going to be a compromise in the end?

Dan Henninger/b>: Oh, yeah, I think there should be a compromise. David, I think this is just wonderful. We've return to normal politics after eight years of having basically no give-and-take between the White House and Congress, or even among the members of Congress. This is what politicians come to Washington to do, is to do politics. And I don't have the slightest doubt that once the conservatives get their hand in there and once there is some give-and-take over this, we are going to get a bill. And were going to get a bill very quickly.

I'm glad to see Washington doing this sort of thing again. I think that's what people wanted to see. This is the opposite of gridlock. Real horse trading.

Asman: I'm just wondering, who gives and who takes, and what does it end up as, this bill.

Joe Rago: Sure. There is this or that detail that can be worked out on the floor in committees in the Senate. But I think it's important to say, amid all of this opposition, this is the most important conservative social policy reform since the 1990s. If you look at what it does to Medicaid, if you look at what it does in the individual insurance market, this is real progress. So there is always good to be some kind of internal division but they are really moving forward here.

Asman: Bill, it's progress unless - and this is part of the horse-trading business that is unappealing to a lot of Americans -- is the swamp-like dealing that goes on inside the Beltway. And whether or not -- in fact, Rand Paul has already said there are so many carveouts to the insurance companies in the GP bill that is unacceptable from that point of view, to which you say what?

Bill McGurn: I would say I think almost all of the conservative critiques are correct in abstract form. It's not what I would pick if I could ram through a reform. But I would also say this is the most important reform that we have, but was a promise that was associated with Republicans. We have to move to better, not best. I think also there is a lot of posturing going on now. But when people realize it's this or nothing, I think working to see a lot of the final opposition melt away.

Remember, the Democrats got in trouble because they rammed it through their own Congress.

Asman: David.

McGurn: By huge majorities. And Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Reid chose to ram it through. Remember --

Asman: I remember well.

McGurn: -- we have to pass it before we find out what's in it?

Asman: That's right.

McGurn: Republicans are doing the opposite way. They're actually debating different provisions.

Asman: And, Kim, you have a chance to read it now. You can get online. It was not that tough of a read. It's about 150 pages.

But I'm just wondering, you know, there is a key element in the Republican problem with Obamacare, which I think is worth mentioning. And Mick Mulvaney, who is a conservative, Freedom Caucus sort of spy, if you well, inside the Trump administration, he might be a great person to negotiate with the hardline conservatives on this. He said it very clearly. He said there is a different between full insurance coverage and health care. You can have full insurance and still have a $12,000 deductible and not be able to afford good health care because of that. That is really one key element the conservatives had a problem with that may be addressed by Donald Trump.

Strassel: I think the point of this here is not just to remedy what is a failing Obamacare system but to set one up that actually works and deliver good and affordable health care to people, with an emphasis on the good. We also need better health care, not just one people can afford to sign up for.

You mentioned Mick Mulvaney. He's the kind of secret weapon here as well. He's basically been living on Capitol Hill, having negotiations with a lot of the more conservative element there and selling this. They have a lot of respect for him. If anybody can talk them around and come to a place where they can get to a deal, this is a guy who is going to be very important in helping.

Asman: Let's talk, Dan, about timing because they have a very aggressive agenda, the Trump administration. They want to do the Obamacare replacement and have tax cuts by August, before the August recess. Do you think they will be able to do it, get all these deals done so they can get a tax cut? We've got to remember, the economy needs a tax cut in order to grow more.

Henninger: The budget reconciliation process is driving the Obamacare bill. It looks like it's moving along pretty well, past two committees. I think some of these problems will be worked out between the conservatives and the moderate. And once they get past that and the numbers that will be scored inside this Obamacare bill, then they can move on to the crucially important matter of the tax bill. And the big thing, factor here is that Donald Trump has been engaged in pushing the Ryan plan for reforming the Affordable Care Act, and I would suspect he will that turn his attention and his energies to politicking with Congress to get that tax bill.

Asman: Bill, quickly, Ronald Reagan really didn't get the details of the tax cuts in for 18 months into his administration, and it wasn't until then that the economy took off. We are in danger here, as good as some signs are. We had a good jobs number on Friday. There are other good signs. Nevertheless, we need a tax cut now to get the economy growing.

Rago: I think that key here is setting priorities. I think Donald Trump has to realize that the two things most important to him this year, apart from the Supreme Court nominee, are tax cuts and Obamacare reform. And he has to make them priorities. And then he has to do what he said he can do, and that's go out and sell it to the people.

Asman: OK, we have a lot more to come. As the FBI probes this week's WikiLeaks dump, a look at the damage done to American intelligence by Jillian Assange's' latest assault.

Julian Assange: The CIA was so careless to produce this material, this enormous cyber weapons arsenal, and lose control of it, at least once, and that it has spread.

Asman: WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, accusing the CIA this week of, quote, "devastating incompetence" for failing to protect its hacking secrets after his anti-secrecy website released thousands of pages describing the tools and the techniques used by the agency to break into Smartphones, computers, even Internet-connected TVs.

The FBI has launched an investigation into this week's document dump, Bill, as the largest leak of CIA material in history of the spy agency. So, Bill, how big of deal is this?

McGurn: It's a very big deal. This is about methods and operations, what we're doing. As Julian Assange describes it, the hacking arsenal. In the 21st century of asymmetric war, if we don't want to invade countries, intelligence, good intelligence will be our number-one asset. This undermines billions in investments and so forth, and the advantages that the United States has in technology. And you're right to call it an assault. It's an assault on the United States. The sensible reason is to stir debate but there are a lot of ways to have a debate, to go to committees and so forth. This was a freelance attack on the United States.

Asman: Joe, what are people out there, most people really more concerned about, the security breach itself or the fact that the government has all of the spy power?

Rago: Look, powers like this can sometimes sound scary, but you have to put in context, which is you are being surveilled all the time by all of your consumer products. Financial companies are watching your credit card transactions. Google is running algorithms on your e-mail. Everything you do online, there's basically no more expectation of privacy. So I guess with things like this, where it is exposed, is any worse than anything else or is this just a routine feature of American life?

Asman: Dan, I've got to say, when I plugged my new TV into the Internet and realized how convenient it was, I wonder people value the convenience over their concern about the loss of privacy?

Henninger: Well, I don't think they should be too concerned about the loss of privacy. You have to understand a few things about what happened here. The CIA has these tools, and they're not using these tools to simply scan the whole galaxy of iPhones and Smart Television. They are using it to go into discrete telephones and individuals that they had targeted. The reason they don't do that is because, all of these companies, Apple, Google and Microsoft themselves are looking for holes in their software. They find them all the time. The best advice I can give people is do those upgrades because they always include security patches. It's just because contractors, outside hackers, they find these things, they tell the companies about them, and they close the patches. The CIA run the risk, if they're running a broad skin of all of these things, of exposing their own tools. They don't need Julian Assange to do that. There's a whole community of software engineers who do this for them.

Asman: Although this --

Henninger: They use very discriminately.

Asman: Kim, this was very costly to the intel community. Let's talk about how they repair the damage. First of all, the cost of this, a lot of their secrets got out, they're going to have to retool a lot of their techniques. And lord knows if anybody's life was put at risk by this.

Strassel: I mean, this is the other part of this discussion, is what failure happened at that U.S. intelligence orbit to allow this. Bill is right, this was an attack, but it was a successful attack. So who failed and where. And then you have a lot of questions about this.

There seems to be some indication that it was a CIA contractor that accessed the information. They are beginning to look through the roles of those people. But there's also questions about other stuff. The House Intelligence Committee has come out with a very forceful statement. It looks like the CIA knew that this happened at the end of last year. Didn't go and tell Congress about it. So I think there is some responsibility questions for the breach as well, how it happened and how you make sure it doesn't happen again.

Asman: To make sure, Bill, President Trump will have to spend a lot more money on intel perhaps --

McGurn: I think Kim is right. The oversight committees and the intelligence committees -- look, I used to work in the White House. The Chinese have my Social Security now because of the different --

Asman: Have they used it?

McGurn: I don't know. The NSA had other leaks. A free society needs to be able to keep secrets. And is not a coincidence that we don't have Beijing's secrets or Moscow's secrets publish out there.

Henninger: How about a word for Julian Assange? I mean, Julian Assange says he wants to work with the CIA. Does Julian Assange, has he ever done a WikiLeaks dump from the Russian FSB or Chinese intelligence?

Henninger: It's always only the United States that Julian Assange seems to be leaking.

Asman: By the way, Joe, he says he also wants to work with the tech companies so that they -- I would think they'd be nuts if they were to open up their doors to Julian Assange. Think of all he could get from them as opposed to giving to them.

Rago: Luckily, that will not happen. This is not --

Asman: As naive as Silicon Valley is, they're not that naive, right?

Rago: I don't think they're very naive. They're studying these dumps to look at ways their encryption may have been compromised. Going forward, I don't think we will see Julian Assange at Mountain View.

Asman: Last answer. Fascinating discussion.

When we come back, the Pentagon confirming that hundreds of U.S. Marines are now on the ground in Syria. So does the deployment signal a shift in U.S. involvement there and the Trump administration's plan to fight ISIS. We'll ask General Jack Keane, coming up next.

Asman: U.S. Marines are now on the ground in Syria. They Pentagon confirming late this week that several hundred Marines have been deployed just outside the northern city of Raqqa where they will support Syrian forces as they try to retake that ISIS stronghold. This, as 2500 U.S. troops are reportedly being sent to Kuwait to serve as backup for coalition forces who are fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Retired four-star Army General Jack Keane is the chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and a FOX News military analyst.

General Keane, first of all, what is the mission there, the military mission?

Gen. Jack Keane: First, the president assigned a mission to the Pentagon, to Secretary Mattis, and that is to defeat ISIS and destroy it. That means not just taking the territory back that ISIS has claimed in Iraq, which is going to be completed in the next few months, and then in Syria, essentially around Raqqa, but also to take their finances away, to take their support system away, to take their virtual caliphate, their Internet operations away, to undermine their ideology, and to help defeat them in the 30-plus countries they have moved into. David, this is the first time since ISIS invaded Iraq that the Pentagon has ever been asked to put together a campaign plan to defeat ISIS.

Asman: A lot of families, including mine, are wondering about how many Marines are going to be there eventually, going to be deployed there. If we succeed in kicking ISIS out of the town, Raqqa, their stronghold, do we occupy? Does that increase our commitment there or what?

Keane: That's a great question. And what is the end state? We have the capability to defeat any enemy that's holding onto territory. The United States of America and the United States military will do that in conjunction with our allies on the ground. But the United States is not going to occupy portions of Syria. We may maintain a base there but we need Syrian Arabs to occupy their own territory. And that's part of the challenge that we are facing here.

Asman: And that gets us to the question of who is our ally there. No matter who we choose, we're going to tick off someone else. If we ally with the Kurds, and they're good fighters, we all know that, that is going to mess up the Turks. The Turks hate the Kurds because they are historical enemies. If we go with the Russians and the Syrians, a lot of people here are going to like that in Congress. And if we go with the Sunni rebels that the Russians have been attacking, that puts us in danger of hitting the Russians. Our alliance is a very tricky thing here.

Keane: You've probably put your finger on the biggest challenge we're facing. The military campaign is one thing. We certainly have, as I mentioned, the capability to deal with that. The political end state, which is what you are describing, is quite another thing. It is the most challenging aspect of all of this. We are currently aligned with the Syrian Kurds, the so-called YPG. The reality is, the YPG is affiliated with other Kurds who are trying to overthrow the Turkish government. So Turkey has been attacking the very forces that our Special Operations forces are aiding and abetting.

Asman: Wow.

Keane: That is how complicated this is. The other thing is, if we use them Syrian Kurds to take over Raqqa, Raqqa is actually Arab territory, and the people there do not want any part of the Kurds occupying their territory. So we have to -- the United States is going to have to be very careful as we deal not just with the military campaign but how we shape the end state. We cannot ignore our allies here. We cannot ignore the Sunni Arabs in the region and we certainly cannot ignore Turkey either.

Asman: Yeah.

Keane: We should not, and I say again, not work with the Russians to deal with Syria.

Asman: That's what we don't do. I don't mean to put you on the sport, General, but what should we do? Who do you think we should be in alliance with?

Keane: I think we should work with the Turks and the Sunni Arabs in the region, and also some of our own forces take Raqqa down. Leave the Sunni Arabs in the region to occupy, pull ourselves out and pull the Turks out. I think that is the best solution.

Asman: If I would think of a worst-case scenario, if you do that alliance, as you suggest, perhaps while the Russians are on some operation trying to hit our Sunni allies, we might inadvertently hit the Russians. I mean we could be a very dangerous situation, right?

Keane: We know where they are and what they're doing. And we can de- conflict our operations from them. They don't want to be within any conflict with us. And we don't want to be in conflict with them. We can avoid it.

Asman: And, General, it sounds, in the end, like you do have confidence in the current military apparatus and their ability to deal with this.

Keane: Yeah, absolutely. After the president-elect, November 8, they recognized there was going to be a new strategy. They began working on it then. They put two months of effort into it, the chairman and the Joint Chiefs. I'm talking about the four service chiefs and the chairmen themselves working with their staff. They put a tremendous effort into it. The president has been briefed on multiple options. He will select what he wants to do, and he wants to be decisive, he wants have a sense of urgency, and he wants it to end.

Asman: Wow.

General Jack Keane, quite a dilemma but it sounds like we have it in hand.

I appreciate it, General. Thank you.

Keane: Yeah, great talking to you, Dave.

Asman: Great talking to you.

Still ahead, challenges are already mounting to President Trump's revised Mideast immigration order. So will it overcome the legal hurdles this time around?

Rex Tillerson: With this order, President Trump is exercising his rightful authority to keep his people safe. While no system can be made completely infallible, the American people can have high confidence we are identifying ways to improve the vetting process and thus keep terrorist from entering our countries.

Asman: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. President Trump signed a revised version of his immigration executive order this week, one his administration vows will hold up in court. The new order bars nationals from Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from traveling to the U.S. for 90 days but removes Iraq from that list. The revised order explicitly exempts foreigners who already have visas. And it will no longer indefinitely block Syrian refugees from resettling in the U.S. It also drops the provision that would have made the process easier for Christian refugees explicitly.

The Trump administration says the changes address the concerns that led a federal judge to block the first order. But the legal fight is far from over, with at least six states already saying they'll challenge the administration in court.

We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, Joe Rago and Bill McGurn.

So, Dan, will this version get through the courts?

Henninger: I think it most likely will get through the courts, because just as you described, they had addressed the issues that were raised in these lawsuits. I think what is going on out by these attorneys general in Democratic states is a crudely political exercise to simply thwart the executive order on the travel ban, no matter what.

But let's make it clear. The war on terror is not going to be won or lost at JFK airport, right? It's going to be won or loss at the places Jack Keane, General Keane was just talking about, Raqqa, Mosul, Yemen, the Middle East. We just heard that the United States has a plan to do that. The idea that the Democrats are now going to try to shut down one piece of that after the administration has addressed their objections turns it into a political circus.

Asman: Kimberly, to Dan's point, the state attorney general for the state of Washington, Bob Ferguson, has said there is no difference between this new order and the old order. So I'm just wondering if the state's attorneys general are saying this, maybe the Ninth Circuit Court will as well.

Strassel: It will be very brazen if that's what that Ninth Circuit Court does. This order is much more competent. It has the rational for the six countries that are there. It actually walks through the legal foundation on which President Trump has the ability to do this, which he very clearly does. The 1952 Immigration Act gives sweeping powers to block any person or class of persons that he deems could be a potential threat to the United States and its security. They will probably still argue that this is a Muslim ban. Given a lot of the changes in that rule and the number of Muslim countries that are not subject to this rule, I think this will be a very hard case to make on legal grounds.

Now, the Ninth Circuit could try it. It's a very liberal court. But if it goes up the chain, especially if Neil Gorsuch get confirmed, to the Supreme Court, I don't think this has a leg to stand on.

Asman: Joe, dealing with the Ninth Circuit, what amazed a lot of people was how they didn't even deal with the law. It kind of made stuff up that wasn't in the law, focusing on some details, even focusing on certain things that were not true, like there's nobody from these countries that have ever been arrested for terrorism, which, in fact, there have been. I'm just wondering if this Ninth Circuit isn't as politically inclined as the attorneys general who oppose it.

Rago: It was a very perfunctory ruling that did not really address the merits of the case.

I tend to think the travel ban is unwise because it's turning into a fight that's between the executive branch and the judiciary. The executive branch has a lot of power here, but kind of willful judges are intruding on the president's core foreign-policy --

Asman: They're making stuff up.

Rago: I know.

Asman: More than intruding, they're making stuff up.

Rago: It is a very dangerous situation and it probably is a confrontation this is not worth having.

Asman: Bill, I don't mean sandbag but I want to switch to a little bit but stay on immigration. There was a huge drop, a 40 percent drop in immigration from the south. From Mexico, a drop in illegal immigration from Mexico. Is this proof that Trumps hardline is paying off?

McGurn: I think we have to wait and see for that. There's been --

Asman: They are taking credit for it.

McGurn: There have been drops before because of the economy. One of the ironies is that when the economy is doing bad, people are the most anti- immigrant, that's when immigrants stop coming. And when the economy is doing well and we have a demand for labor, they come more. So I think it is too early to tell.

On the Trump approach, I think a good principle of government is that is, if it's not necessary to do or say something, it's necessary not to say or do it. I think the Trump administration learned the hard way with its first executive order and has revised it. It be nice if the courts do the same thing. This is not just a matter of a policy disagreement. As Joe suggested, we are getting close to a constitutional confrontation. And if one side is just going to politicize it, it's going to be an ugly ending no matter where we go.

Asman: Very quickly, Dan, if it does go to the Supreme Court, that can be quite a while before it's actually implemented. I'm just wondering if it will defeat the purpose. Remember, there was all this talk about timing when the first order came out. If we have to wait another three or four months, maybe a lot of bad people will get into the country.

Henninger: Well, I think, as Kim was pointing out, it would be a very brazen thing for them for the Ninth Circuit to do that, especially to issue an injunction against the entire order. There might be one piece of it that they would pull out. But I think the order is going to go forward the 90 days. It's only a 90-day period in which these people are going to be banned from the U.S. And if it got to the Supreme Court, after Gorsuch got approved, I think the president's authority would be upheld.

Asman: Very good.

Still ahead, Democrats are calling for a special prosecutor to look at Russia's role in the 2016 election, but is an outside investigation really the way to go? Our panel debating that, coming next.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein : I believe we need an independent criminal investigation into Russians influence. It's vitally important that the American people have trust in this investigation and that there's not even the appearance of a conflict of interest or political influence. So that is why I continue to support the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Asman: Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and questions about Russia's ties to President Trump's campaign. And his claim that former President Obama wiretapped his New York offices turned Tuesday's confirmation hearing for deputy attorney general nominee, Rod Rosenstein, into a contentious partisan battle. The Democrats calling on Rosenstein to commit to an outside investigation.

Kimberly, let's talk about a special prosecutor. The only Republican to event hint that it might be necessary was Darrell Issa, and he quickly rolled that back once he realized that he put his foot in it. Any other Republican come out for a special prosecutor?

Strassel: No, because it's an absolutely atrocious idea. Here's why. Special prosecutors exist to prosecute. They go in and they begin an investigation and their goal is to find some sort of criminal wrongdoing, not necessarily to expose what has happened. And they go down rabbit holes. And also, look, the goal of this ought to be transparency, to come clean to the American people about what actually happened over the last six months, both to do with Russian interference, but also President Obama's role, if any, and his intelligence agencies looking into this, how the investigation has been conducted, and get that out into the people as quickly as possible. That will never happen under a special prosecutor.

Asman: Bill, I just wonder with whom the Democrats called for one is going to resonate. They've kind of backed themselves in the corner, not only with Republicans and the Trump administration but with the public in terms of screaming about everything. If you scream about everything, you can't sell anything, right, because people think it's -- you're just going to scream no matter what happens.

McGurn: It's not resonating with me. I had two "S" words that I object to.

McGurn: One is "Schumer" and the other is "special."

McGurn: Chuck Schumer proposing a special prosecutor, you really wonder.

Look, we do need investigations of things, but one of the problems of the last few decades is that we've got away from regular process and how Congress works and how the White House works, and we need to get back. We have a good constitutional system. We have the means. Congress has the means to investigate these things. And instead of looking for these short- circuit ways to go like a special prosecutor, we need to get back to regular order and do these things through the process laid out in our Constitution, which works pretty well.

Asman: Joe, there does seem to be a kind of cordial relationship between the House Intel Committee, which is going to investigate some of this, between the Republicans and the Democrats. So it is possible for a bipartisan committee to get some work done on this, right?

Rago: It's probably the last bipartisan committee left in Congress.

Asman: I think you're right.

Rago: I'm just wondering what Democrats are hoping to find here. We know Russia interfered in the election by hacking the e-mails of John Podesta and the DNC, but that's it. Vladimir Putin didn't force Hillary Clinton not to campaign in Wisconsin.

Asman: Right.

Rago: So it seems to be more of a coping mechanism then a serious inquiry.

Asman: But, Dan, we know what the golden ring is. The Democrats want to find some, for them, proof that there was collusion between the Russians and the Trump administration. All the intel people, by the way, including ones appointed by Democrats, say there is none. There is no evidence of that.

Henninger: Not only that, David, but all of these media reports always have a paragraph in there saying nothing is known for sure. The Democrats want the special prosecutor to investigate the Trump presidency all the way between now and the Midterm election so this anvil is hanging over it.

But, look, Barack Obama released an executive order which allowed all 17 investigative agencies to have what the NSA had found. If they haven't found anything so far, the special prosecutor hasn't found anything. I think the resolution to this, they've got something obviously that was released. That should be put on the desk of the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. He should look at it and make some determination. Either there is no "there" there, or some part of it needs to be investigated.

Asman: Kimberly, there is -- a special prosecutor very often goes on this fishing expeditions and turns up stuff that maybe wasn't the original purpose of the investigation. I think that's also why Democrats want to have it, right?

Strassel: Exactly what Dan just said. They want a special prosecutor who is going to investigate Trump for the next two years begin by looking into these Russia allegations but then follow this down any rabbit hole that exists and find any little tiny slip up here or there, if there is one, blow into something and give them grounds for impeachment. The Russians would be mad to allow -- I'm sorry. The Republicans would be made to allow this to happen. Lots of Russians going on.

Asman: I know. Democrats are going to look at you, Kimberly, and say, oh, there was a Freudian slip. There's the key.

All right, thank you very much.

Last word from Kimberly.

When we come back, the Trump administration says all options are on the table following North Korea's latest ballistic missile test.

Amb. Nikki Haley : They said that their goal is to be able to reach the United States and Japan. This is not something we can take lightly. We are stepping back, and sense these multiple launches, reevaluating what the U.S.'s approach is going to be. I can tell you we are not ruling anything out and we are considering every option that's on the table.

Asman: U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, warning that nothing is off the table when it comes to the Trump administration's response to North Korea after that country test fired four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan on Monday. Dictator Kim Jong-Un announced in January that his regime is in the, quote, "final stage in developing a nuclear-capable missile that could reach parts of the United States."

Joining me now from Toronto is Gordon Chang. He's the author of "Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes on the World."

So, Gordon, let's go right to your book's title, "Nuclear Showdown." What would a nuclear showdown with North Korea look like?

Gordon Chang: It would be extremely ugly. North Korea has somewhere between 16 and 20 warheads. And also, we have to remember that North Korea has a formal military ally, China. Last time there was a general war on the Korean Peninsula, China came in on North Korea's side, and it could very well do so this time as well, because China leader, Xi Jinping, considers the U.S. as China's strategic adversary.

Asman: OK. We'll talk more about China in a moment, but specifically on a nuclear showdown, they claim that their missiles are going to be nuclear capable soon. Do you believe them?

Chang: Yes. They already have three missiles that can probably hit the lower 48 states. The Typonon 2 (ph), KNOA (ph) and the KN14 (ph). They haven't been adequately tested but they are based on proven technologies. Within four years, maybe five at the outside, they'll be able to mate a warhead to those long-raise launchers and they will be able to hold us at ransom.

Asman: What about our anti-missile capability? Could we shot them down before they get here?

Chang: We have interceptors in both Alaska and California but they're rudimentary. They have about a 56 percent failure rate under perfect conditions. The answer is that probably North Korea will be able to land a nuke in the United States if it chooses to do so.

Asman: Here's the big question: What do we do? We're not going to wait until they have that capability and put the nuke on a missile. We're going to take them out or take out their capability before that happens. Can we? And how could we?

Chang: We could do that because we have conventional capabilities. We have a nuclear arsenal that is quite large. But we're going to do that because any sort of military action risks a general conventional war on the Korean Peninsula. We have to remember that about half of South Korea's 50 million people are in the Seoul area, about 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas. So the military option is absolutely the last thing.

There are number of things that we can do, David. We tried almost every approach over the last two decades and they failed. The one thing we haven't tried is to impose costs on China for its support for North Korea's ballistic missile program, nuclear weapons program and other illicit commerce.

Asman: But you are hearing more stories that China -- even though China is so key for North Korea, they're losing some of their influence with North Korea, and North Korea is going rogue. Is that true?

Chang: To a certain extent, but we have to remember that China supports North Korea, not because the North Koreans are friendly but because the North Koreans accomplished some very important strategic objectives for China in the short term, of keeping us off balance and giving us an incentive to cooperate with China on other things. So although the relations are indeed much strained than they have been in previous years, I'm not so sure China's going to cut off its support for North Korea.

Asman: Now there is another element here that just happened this week that complicates things. The South Korean president was kicked out of office. She was involved in some corruption, they had an impeachment, and they got rid of her. How does that complicate the whole scenario?

Chang: There has to be an election within 60 days, probably May 9th. And the polls show the so-called progressives, or the leftists, are going to win, and that could change every calculus in north Asia and shift the balance of power in favor of North Korea and China.

But we have to remember that the South Korean electorate is very volatile. They can change their minds on basically a dime. That happened in 2002. I think we very well may see. Because Kim Jong-Un and China may create provocations that change the views of the South Korean electorate at the last moment.

Asman: Would that change our military or potential military approach? I understand that Seoul, the capitol of South Korea, is right next to the DMZ, the border with North Korea, but we can -- China doesn't have sufficient influence to stop them from using one of these nukes. And it may not just be on a missile, by the way. They may sell it to a terrorist group or something like that as well.

Chang: Well, clearly. Or they could smuggle one in, assemble in New York City, and set it off. Or they could put it on a cargo ship. There's so many ways North Korea can deliver a nuclear weapon to the American homeland. But with Seoul, if it changes sides -- and it could very well do so -- that really restricts what we can do on the Korean Peninsula, both from a diplomatic point of view and from a military one as well.

Asman: A lot of danger there.

Gordon Chang, author of "Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes on the World."

Thank you very much, Gordon. Good to see you. Good to have you on.

We have to take one more break. When we come back, "Hits Misses" of the week.

Asman: Time now for our "Hits Misses" of the week.

Kim, first to you.

Strassel: So, David, as we get closer to two time-honored traditions, Tax Day and spring break, here's a myth that unites them both. A recent survey by a group called LENDEDU found that almost one-third of college students are intending to use their student loan money to pay for their spring breaks. And since you, the taxpayer, federally subsidize that loan, it means you are paying for a lot of tequila and beach time.

Asman: Oh, my gosh.

Strassel: And why wouldn't they do this, by the way, because another survey from the same group found that nearly half of them believe their federal debt will be taken away and forgiven.

Asman: That's right. It's free. It's free.

Strassel: Yeah, it's free.

Asman: Bill, because we can't get enough of these wacky college students, you've got another thing from the college students?

McGurn: Yeah, double myths this week. Remember those protesters at Middlebury College trying to shutdown Libertarian scholar, Charles Murray? Many of the headlines, including one over the Associated Press stories, basically identified him as a white nationalist. The accusation comes courtesy of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a left-leaning organization, that exists I think primarily to smear people that it disagrees with as racists and extremists. So a miss not only to the Southern Poverty Law Center but to the press that too uncritically takes their accusations.

Asman: Joe, you have a hit?

Rago: Yeah. I did not think there was anything that could make me like Uber more but it turns out there is. This week, news emerged that the ride-hailing service systematically gray-balled local governments that were trying to preserve taxing monopolies in their city, feeding them fake apps, fake information --

Asman: Oh.

Rago: -- trying to overt stings. This is hit for creative destruction for innovation and consumers.

Asman: Undermining the regulators.

Dan, we need good news from overseas. We've had a lot scary stuff.

Henninger: In fact, I've got some, David. I'm giving a hit to Iraq and the army of Iraq, which, since last October, has been slugging it out with Islamic State to retake some of the biggest cities there, like Mosul, from Islamic State. Just this past week, they penetrated the west end of Mosul. They are succeeding. And this is an army that has been an object of mockery by the American left. I think they deserve credit for spending blood and treasure --

Asman: Absolutely.

Henninger: -- to defend their own country.

Asman: Good stuff, guys.

That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm David Asman. You can catch me weekdays at "After the Bell" on the FOX Business Network. Paul is back next week. We hope to see you then.

A bus plowed into people at a street festival in the city of Gonaives, Haiti, early Sunday, killing at least 34 people and injuring 17, officials said.

At about 3 a.m. a passenger bus first hit two people at a bus stop and then continued into a crowd of people participating in an Easter season musical celebration, said Josepth Faustin, civil-defense coordinator for the region. Angry festivalgoers attacked the bus and tried to burn it before police rescued the passengers, Mr. Faustin said.

The Weekend Interview with Hany Farid: How Algorithms Can Help Beat Islamic State

Hanover, N.H. -- You can't blame the message on the medium, not exactly. But maybe, all things considered, arming everyone with pocket supercomputers, and then filtering most of human experience through social-media feedback loops, wasn't the greatest idea.

America recently endured the most electronic and media-saturated presidential campaign in memory, with its hacks, private servers, secret videotapes, fake news, troll armies and hour-by-hour internet outrage across all platforms. And however glorious modern communications may be, they've also empowered a cast of goons, crooks and jihadists to build audiences and influence world-wide.

A technological solution, at least to that last problem, may lie 2,600 miles east of Silicon Valley, in a computer-science laboratory at Dartmouth College. Prof. Hany Farid, chairman of the department, creates algorithms that can sweep digital networks and automatically purge extremist content -- if only the tech companies will adopt them.

"If you look at recent attacks, from Orlando to San Bernardino to Nice to Paris to Brussels," Mr. Farid says, "all of those attackers had been radicalized online. They weren't going to Syria. They watched YouTube videos."

He continues: "The dark side of the open internet is that truly fringe and harmful ideas now are mainstream, or at least accessible to 7 1/2 billion people." Yet "whenever we have one of these attacks, we just wring our hands for a few weeks and then wait for the next one to happen."

Social networks have created "a new environment for radicalization and recruitment," says David Ibsen, executive director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization to which Mr. Farid is a senior adviser. Terror groups weaponize Twitter, Google, Facebook and other forums to plan or encourage violence; to discover the vulnerable or disaffected; and to publish professional, sophisticated and carefully presented propaganda.

Islamic State is basically a digital-first media startup. (By comparison, al Qaeda was MySpace.) ISIS content is beamed out globally and becomes refractory across the viral web. Some videos show vignettes of ISIS bureaucrats delivering social services or its fighters talking about the battle between belief and unbelief. Others are more savage -- beheadings, stonings, drownings, other torture and combat operations.

Mr. Farid slipped into this world slant-wise. He's a founder of the computer-science field known as digital forensics. In the late 1990s as a postdoctoral researcher, he was among the first to recognize that mathematical and computational techniques to authenticate digital images and other media would be useful to society.

Because images so powerfully change what we are willing to believe, the modern era requires a scientific method to ensure we can trust them. How can we prove, for example, that digital photographs aren't forgeries so they are admissible as evidence in court? Images are increasingly important in cellular, molecular and neurological medicine, Mr. Farid notes, and tampering has led to more than one research-and-retraction scandal. Unscrupulous stringers sometimes file doctored photos with news organizations, and unscrupulous motorists sometimes photoshop pictures to exaggerate fender-benders for insurance claims.

Mr. Farid explains how image authentication works: "We think about how light interacts in the physical world; what happens when that light hits the front of the lens and gets focused and goes through an optical train; what happens when that light hits an electronic sensor and gets converted from an analog to a digital and then goes through a postprocessing and gets saved as .jpeg and then gets posted on Facebook." By identifying "statistical and geometrical and physical regularities" in this life cycle, software can search for inconsistencies to expose manipulation.

In 2008 this research pulled Mr. Farid into another underworld -- child pornography. In 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a ban on "virtual" child porn -- computer-generated images that "appear to depict minors but were produced without using any real children." Mr. Farid is sometimes brought in as an outside expert when a defendant claims the material at issue is virtual.

The child-porn industry was nearly defunct by the 1990s, because negatives and videotapes can be confiscated and destroyed. "Then the internet came," Mr. Farid says, "and all hell broke loose."

Supply can create its own demand. Much like jihadists, deviants formed a global community, finding each other online and sharing what are really crime-scene photos. Like ISIS agitprop, material is continuously copied, cut, spliced, resized, recompressed and otherwise changed, in part to evade detection as it is retransmitted again and again.

Mr. Farid worked with Microsoft to solve both problems -- detection and replication. He coded a tool called Photo DNA that uses "robust hashing" to sweep for child porn. "The hashing part is that you reach into a digital image and extract a unique signature. The robust part is if that image undergoes simple changes, the fingerprint shouldn't change. When you change your clothes, cut your hair, as you age, your DNA stays constant," he says. "That's what you want from this distinct fingerprint."

The algorithm matches against a registry of known illegal signatures, or hashes, to find and delete photographs, audio and video. Photo DNA is engineered to work at "internet scale," says Mr. Farid, meaning it can process billions of uploads a day in microseconds with a low false-positive rate and little human intervention.

Monitoring by Photo DNA, which is licensed by Microsoft at no cost and now used in most networks, revealed that the nature of the problem was "not what we thought it was," says Ernie Allen, the retired head of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Child pornography was far more widely circulated than law enforcement believed. "Hany Farid changed the world," Mr. Allen adds. "His innovation rescued or touched the lives of thousand of kids, and uncovered perpetrators, and prevented terrible revictimization as content was constantly redistributed."

Mr. Farid linked up with the Counter Extremism Project to apply the same robust-hashing method to extremist propaganda. But this effort has encountered resistance. "The pushback from the tech companies has been pretty strong," the project's Mr. Ibsen says dryly.

U.S. law immunizes internet companies from criminal and civil liability for content that travels over their transoms. Their terms of service forbid abusive content, but they rely on users instead of algorithms to police violations. "It's a very slow and tedious process: You wait for it to get reported, somebody has to review it, they make mistakes," Mr. Farid says. "They take down the Vietnam napalm girl on Facebook."

Liability aside, what about their moral obligations to help prevent death, injury and destruction? "In my mind, we're not asking them even to do something that they haven't said they want to do already. We're saying, hey, would you please do the thing that you promised you would do?" he explains. "I am simply saying, look, for free, you can automate this and make it really efficient and really fast and save you money on the side."

But the "ethos" of Silicon Valley doesn't include becoming the censors of the internet, and tech firms fear a slippery slope. "The concern they have is, OK, first they came for the child porn, then they came for the extremism, next they're going to take the kitten videos," Mr. Farid says. "I think that's a bit of a hysterical leap. We are talking about content with very clear and well-defined harm. These are not abstract notions -- 'I don't want people to be mean to me.' We're not talking about bullying. We are talking about things with very immediate consequences and very real harm."

One question is how to distinguish support for terrorism from the merely inappropriate or objectionable. What about Islamic State's black-flag brand, or a declaration of a caliphate, or the sermons of Anwar al-Awlaki? Maybe you know it when you see it.

"Is an ISIS fighter saying 'Death to the West' extremism? I don't know. I don't want to have that conversation," Mr. Farid replies. "I'm talking about explicit acts of violence, explicit calls to violence, explicit glorification of violence, depravity, the worst of the worst of the worst."

His point is that tech companies can make judgment calls about the middle ground, wherever it might be, for themselves: "You decide: Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, and then we'll build a cache and eliminate that content from your networks."

Mr. Farid concedes that there are dangers: "This type of technology is agnostic in what it's looking for. It can be used in ways we would not approve of, such as stifling speech. You can't deny that. This is what we've learned about technology over the years -- it can be used for good and for bad. Social media platforms can be good and bad."

There has been some progress. Twitter has deleted hundreds of thousands of handles associated with terrorism since 2015, and late last year Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft and YouTube announced an industry antiterror consortium. But Mr. Farid's robust hashing remains a hard sell.

The irony is that algorithms increasingly govern the world. Networks are perpetually scanned for spam, malware, viruses; Google reads your email to target ads; credit-card companies monitor your financial transactions to prevent fraud. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg even promises to use algorithms to distinguish truth from falsehood. As a scholar of the differences between the two, Mr. Farid has a few thoughts.

In the backwash of 2016, Mr. Zuckerberg published a 5,800-word manifesto that promised Facebook's artificial intelligence would soon learn to sort real news from hoaxes and misinformation, break up "filter bubbles," and draw a line between free speech and suborning terror. The goal, he wrote, is to preserve "our shared sense of reality."

Mr. Farid is a skeptic: "As somebody who worked for a long time in this space, I think he's underestimating what a hard problem this is." Mr. Zuckerberg "paints this picture like machine learning is going to be fully automatic -- basically you'll be able to set criteria on your page, 'I don't want to see violence, I don't want to see bad words,' and it'll just work.

"Even as a technologist, and despite all the advance of technology, the human brain is astonishing at what it does. Our ability to make these types of assessments that are really hard for these AI algorithms is humbling. I don't think we'll get it in the next five or 10 years."

Meantime, Mr. Farid has developed a technology that could work today to contain a growing threat. While we await the Facebook utopia, perhaps our digital lives -- and our real lives -- would be healthier if it were widely deployed.

U.S. Split Over Plan to Take Raqqa From Islamic State; Trump administration officials are split over strategy for pushing militant group out of its Syria stronghold

U.S. hopes of capturing Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa have become entangled in an intense debate over the offensive that is threatening to delay key decisions for weeks, according to U.S. officials.

The Trump administration is facing internal divisions over the strategy for pushing Islamic State out of Raqqa without alienating Turkey, a vital North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally that opposes America's ongoing work with Kurdish fighters in Syria that Ankara views as terrorists.

Because of Turkey's opposition, the new administration may not finalize its plans for taking Raqqa until Turkey votes April 16 on a referendum that would give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sweeping powers, according to U.S. officials involved in the internal debate.

"Everything is red hot," said one senior administration official involved in the debate.

While the debate in Washington continues, rival forces in Syria are jockeying for position on the battlefield in an effort to expand their influence. That has created a dangerous flashpoint at the northern Syrian town of Manbij, where Russian and American forces are within striking distance of each other. Russia is the Syrian regime's most powerful ally.

At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) expressed concern about the situation in Syria.

"I think there's a possibility of an impending conflict between Turkey and the Kurds, as opposed to us working together to try to defeat ISIS and remove them from Raqqa," Mr. McCain said to Gen. Joe Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees the fight in Syria.

"We are trying to take actions to prevent that from occurring," Gen. Votel said.

Pentagon officials said Thursday that the military has moved the first of what could be hundreds of Marines into Syria, where they would provide artillery support for ground forces preparing for the assault on Raqqa.

A central unresolved question is who the U.S. should work with to push Islamic State out of Raqqa. Some U.S. officials are pressing the White House to re-evaluate America's close military ties with the Kurdish fighters in Syria as a way to assuage Mr. Erdogan. Others want the U.S. to work with Kurdish forces to take Raqqa, but then consider handing control of the city over to a local council sympathetic to the Syrian regime and its Russian backers.

"There's not anything near an agreement or a plan," said a senior U.S. military official. "It's up to the White House."

The Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said Thursday that Turkey was waiting for the U.S. decision about its strategy and choice of partner for the battle for Raqqa, and warned that bilateral relations would suffer if U.S. support for its Syrian Kurdish partners continued.

Another senior administration official said it likely will be weeks before President Donald Trump makes a decision. Part of the delay is due to an effort to determine how the strategy in Raqqa fits into the broader fight against Islamic State in Iraq, Syria and beyond. Iraqi forces have pushed deep into western Mosul in recent days, shrinking the territory held by Islamic State in its last major stronghold in Iraq.

"It's got to be connected to the larger campaign," the official said, adding that officials are trying to determine "how you completely integrate the strategy."

The issue of Kurdish fighters is "among many issues that have got to be worked out," the official said.

Last week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sent the White House his 30-day review of the strategy for fighting Islamic State. Hopes for a quick decision from Mr. Trump have given way to a growing realization that the debate is unsettled.

"The aim is there to take Raqqa quickly, but we're all waiting for Washington to move forward on a plan," said a senior European diplomat who is part of the "Friends of Syria" alliance, a coalition of 11 Western and Arab countries led by the U.S. that once opposed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule, although some members have softened to the Syrian president as he has recaptured territory over the years.

Despite Turkey's objections, the Obama administration pressed ahead with a military strategy that relies heavily on the Kurdish force, known as the YPG, that is working with U.S. special operations forces to encircle Raqqa. The YPG and its Arab allies are now less than 6 miles outside of the Islamic State stronghold as they await word from Washington on the new strategy.

Inside the Trump administration, one faction is pushing the White House to directly arm the YPG, a move that would antagonize Mr. Erdogan.

Another faction is struggling to find ways to allay Mr. Erdogan's concerns about America's work with the Kurdish forces. In one effort to do so, some administration officials are urging the White House to re-evaluate America's relationship with the Kurdish fighters after the fight for Raqqa.

Untangling American ties with the YPG could be difficult. The U.S. currently has hundreds of special operations forces working with the Kurdish fighters in Syria, where they control 20,000 square miles of territory.

And finding an alternative fighting force in Syria has repeatedly failed. Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency programs to arm and train Syrian rebels have fallen flat.

U.S. officials are skeptical of Turkey's longstanding vow to send in its Syrian proxies to take Raqqa, yet agree on the need to have a Sunni Arab force play a central role in taking and governing the city after Islamic State is pushed out. But there is no agreement on who can take the job. That has raised the prospect of giving it to local forces sympathetic to the Syrian regime or its allies. Similar handoffs occurred with villages around Manbij last week, raising the prospect that could be a blueprint for Raqqa.

Meanwhile, the situation in Manbij has devolved into a dangerous proxy war.

With reluctant Turkish support, U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab forces seized the city from Islamic State last summer. Turkey recently threatened to send fighters into Manbij, triggering a move by Russia and the Syrian regime to counter any possible advance.

The U.S. military has taken the unusual step of sending American forces into Manbij, where they are acting as a physical buffer between Turkish-backed fighters who have threatened to advance in Manbij, Syrian regime forces and the Manbij military council, which governs the city.

That has increased the risk for U.S. troops, who have been videotaped driving into Manbij with American flags flying from their armored vehicles.

"There's obviously a degree of cautious concern, but I don't see it as, ‘h my god, the alarm bells are going off,'" said the senior U.S. military official.

World News:  ISIS  Launches Deadly Raid on Kabul Hospital

KABUL -- Islamic State fighters disguised as doctors fought elite government forces inside Afghanistan's largest military hospital on Wednesday in a seven-hour battle that left at least 30 people dead and 50 others wounded, Afghan officials said.

Islamic State's regional affiliate, Khorasan Province, said it carried out the attack, which began when a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb at the entrance of the heavily guarded medical facility in the Afghan capital. In a statement, Khorasan Province said four of its fighters armed with suicide vests then entered the compound.

As the gunmen and security forces exchanged fire inside the complex, hospital personnel scurried to protect patients and evacuate them to safety. Among those killed were an unknown number of doctors, the Afghan Defense Ministry said.

A photo distributed by Islamic State's official Amaq news agency purportedly taken inside the besieged hospital showed what it said was a militant posing next to an automatic rifle, wearing a surgical mask and holding a dagger. Another photo showed the bodies of unidentified victims. All the gunmen died in the fighting, Afghan officials said.

The assault on the U.S.-funded Dawood National Hospital, along with the expected start soon of the Taliban's spring offensive, could increase pressure on the Trump administration to deploy more troops to Afghanistan.

In testimony to Congress last month, Army Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan, said more coalition troops were needed to end what he described as a stalemate in the 16-year-old war.

Wednesday's attack wasn't the first on Dawood National Hospital. The facility, which is operated by the Afghan army and treats only members of the security forces and their relatives, was hit in 2011 by the Taliban, Afghanistan's largest insurgency, an assault that left six people dead.

The Taliban denied involvement in the latest attack on the hospital. Dawlat Waziri, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said it didn't matter which of the two groups was responsible.

"They are both enemies of the people and of this country," the spokesman said. "We will eliminate them."

The assault reflects the growing strength of Khorasan Province, Islamic State's regional branch. Aided by their disguises, the attackers succeeded in penetrating the thick security cordon around the highly fortified compound in the heart of Kabul near embassies and military installations.

Since emerging in 2014, Khorasan Province has operated mainly in eastern Afghanistan and in small areas of western Pakistan. Recently, it has shifted its focus and carried out high-profile attacks in Kabul, adopting tactics long used by the Taliban.

The 10-Point. A personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal, from Editor in Chief Gerard Baker .

Good morning,

Yesterday I sat down with Rwanda's President Paul Kagame at the WSJ Investing in Africa conference  in London. The guerrilla fighter turned president—n power for more than two decades—aid the political tumult in the U.S. and Europe should spur African nations to carve out a path independent of Western trade, aid or influence. I invite you to watch the interview here .

Spy vs. Hacker

WikiLeaks released a massive trove of documents  and files yesterday that it says exposes how the CIA hacks smartphones, computer operating systems, message applications and internet-connected televisions, in what would be one of the biggest breaches in the spy agency's history. The group said the release, which it dubbed Vault 7, consists of 8,761 documents and files from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence. The revelations fuel a continuing debate over whether intelligence agencies that discover security flaws in popular technology  should disclose them, so that the users can defend themselves from hackers , or keep that information secret for use in intelligence operations. If the leak is deemed authentic, it will also raise questions over the extent to which U.S. national security may have been compromised, given the exposure of the CIA's toolbox for conducting cyberespionage .

Second Opinions

An array of conservative lawmakers and activist groups yesterday critiqued a proposal by House GOP leaders to overturn the 2010 health law , posing the first major test of the Trump administration's ability to broker deals among Republicans in Congress. Members of two conservative House caucuses, at least three right-leaning GOP senators and a set of allied groups outside Congress signaled their dissatisfaction with the health plan. Mr. Trump endorsed the legislation but left open the question of whether he would lobby personally and forcefully for it. He met with House lawmakers responsible for gathering votes for the bill and urged them to move swiftly. But he signaled that the task, at least for now, falls to congressional leaders. Some conservatives said the legislation looks too much like the law it was meant to replace. We outline how the proposal would affect consumers .

Rainy-Day Reserves

Central banks around the world are increasing foreign-currency reserves , highlighting the fragile underpinnings of the global economic recovery despite a bullish mood in financial markets. Two-thirds of the 30 biggest emerging markets increased reserves last year, and foreign-currency holdings in Israel, Vietnam and the Czech Republic recently reached records. China's foreign reserves rose by $6.9 billion in February compared with the previous month, while some central banks in Europe have also been padding their coffers. Rising reserve balances can be a reassuring sign for investors because they show that individual nations have some capacity to deal with market shocks or economic downturns. But many analysts worry that underlying the reserve buildup are global trade and capital imbalances that could make the world vulnerable to a fresh crisis should the flow of capital be disrupted.

Write It Out

If you're having trouble getting your child to share thoughts with you, you might try a diary. Parents and children are using journals to communicate and deepen their relationships , especially during awkward adolescence. Sharing a private communication can help during some of the toughest years. Parents decide with their children what their approach will be: who is allowed to see the book; how and where the journal will be passed back and forth. They also agree on how often to write, perhaps weekly or monthly. When a parent and child are writing back and forth, it can balance out a relationship where the parent is usually the one with the upper hand. The method worked so well for one mother-daughter duo that they co-wrote a DIY version for others.

Reader Response

Responding to yesterday's question on the House GOP plan to replace Obamacare , Bill Kaupert of Illinois said: "The GOP health plan seems an excellent first step. It reduces government involvement in individual health care and increases individual choice on a gradual basis. Pending a similar resolution of the remaining details, it's a great start." But Steve Shannon of New Jersey weighed in: "The House GOP plan to replace Obamacare has as many if not more shortcomings than the Affordable Care Act. It's nothing more than political theater aimed at pleasing the GOP base rather than an honest attempt at solving what's a really serious issue for our country." And Martin M. Bress of California commented: "Millions of people will lose insurance coverage because of unaffordable costs."

Dozens Killed in  ISIS  Attack on Kabul Military Hospital; The gunmen disguised themselves as doctors to penetrate the hospital's security cordon

KABUL—slamic State fighters disguised as doctors fought elite government forces inside Afghanistan's largest military hospital on Wednesday in a seven-hour battle that left at least 30 people dead and 50 others wounded, Afghan officials said.

Islamic State's regional affiliate, Khorasan Province, said it carried out the attack, which began when a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb at the entrance of the heavily guarded medical facility in the Afghan capital.

Another photo showed the bodies of unidentified victims. All the gunmen died in the fighting, Afghan officials said.

The assault on the U.S.-funded Dawood National Hospital, along with the expected start soon of the Taliban's spring offensive, could increase pressure on the Trump administration to deploy more troops to Afghanistan.

In testimony to U.S. Congress last month, Army Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan, said more coalition troops were needed in the country to end what he described as a stalemate in the 16-year-old war.

Wednesday's attack wasn't the first on Dawood National Hospital. The facility, which is operated by the Afghan army and treats only members of the country's security forces and their relatives, was hit in 2011 by the Taliban, Afghanistan's largest insurgency, an assault that left six people dead.

The Taliban denied any involvement in the latest attack on the hospital. Dawlat Waziri, a defense ministry spokesman, said it didn't matter which of the two groups were responsible.

The assault on the hospital reflects the growing strength of Khorasan Province, Islamic State's regional branch. Aided by their disguises, the attackers succeed in penetrating the thick security cordon around the highly fortified hospital compound, which is located in the heart of Kabul near embassies and military installations.

Since emerging in 2014, Khorasan Province has operated mainly in eastern Afghanistan and in small areas of western Pakistan. Recently, it has shifted its focus and carried out high-profile attacks in Kabul, adopting tactics long used by the Taliban.

Last month, an Islamic State fighter detonated his suicide vest at the gates of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, killing 21 people and wounding 41 others. The group said the bombing was aimed at judges and their staff, according to a statement carried by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors global jihadist activity.

Islamic State also frequently targets Afghanistan's minority Shiites, whom it considers apostates. In the most recent attack, a suicide bomber killed about 30 worshipers in a Shiite mosque in Kabul.

The assault on Wednesday is the latest by armed groups in the capital, as government forces continue to suffer high casualties as they struggle to maintain security.

The Taliban carried out attacks against two Afghan security compounds last week, killing 21 people. Among the dead were Afghan civilians, who have become increasingly victimized by the fighting.

In a report issued in February, the United Nations said more than 11,400 civilians were either killed or injured last year, the highest number since the organization began gathering data eight years ago.

The U.S.-led international military coalition condemned Wednesday's attack on the hospital, which was the focus of a U.S. congressional investigation following allegations in 2011 of corruption and patient neglect.

"Once again insurgents show complete disrespect for humanity by attacking a hospital. We stand with Afghan people against terrorism," the coalition said on Twitter.

Islamic State Plotted to Attack Saudi Royals During Malaysia Visit; Suspected  ISIS  associates prepared a car bomb for King Salman's visit last month

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—uspected militants linked to Islamic State were stopped just short of attacking Saudi royals during King Salman's recent trip here, Malaysian police said, dealing with a second high-profile plot after a hit squad allegedly led by North Koreans recently staged a brazen killing at the main airport.

"We got them in the nick of time," Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said Tuesday. Three teams of militants had planned attacks on the Saudis, he said, but he declined to give details of their alleged plans. One group comprised four Yemenis, another an Indonesian and a Malaysian, and a third a lone man from an unspecified East Asian nation.

Malaysia, without specifying the targets, initially announced the arrests Sunday and said they were carried out between Feb. 21 and Feb. 26. Police said two of the men were directed by Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, a Malaysian who joined Islamic State in Syria in 2015, in preparing a car bomb. The Indonesian arrested had previously been deported to Turkey after trying to enter Syria, police said.

Police said the East Asian suspect, believed to have been living in Malaysia on a student visa since 2011, had suspected links to a regional terrorist group that uses Malaysia as a transit point and safe haven.

The Saudi king has been leading an entourage of up to 1,500 people on a monthlong tour of Asia to strengthen ties with a region the kingdom sees as an increasingly valuable economic partner and as a hedge against an unpredictable U.S. government.

Malaysia was the first stop. The monarch traveled on to Indonesia and now is on a weeklong holiday on the resort island of Bali before heading to Japan, China and elsewhere.

A spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

The foiled plot against the delegation underscores Islamic State's ongoing campaign against the Saudi kingdom. The group has called for the downfall of the Saudi monarchy and, since the militant group's rise in 2014, its loyalists have carried out a score of small-scale attacks in the kingdom.

Islamic State sees Saudi royals as heretics and enemies in part because of their longstanding alliance with the U.S. and the West. The Sunni Muslim terror group has also sought to challenge the Saudi monarch's role as guardian of Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.

In July, a suicide bomber killed four security guards near the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, an attack that bore the hallmarks of Islamic State. It was one of three bombings that struck the kingdom within hours of each other on the eve of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr.

Saudi Arabia has confronted the threat of Islamic extremism before. Al Qaeda turned its wrath against the kingdom in the prior decade, a campaign that was effectively suppressed by Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, the current crown prince.

Prince Mohammed in 2009 narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by an al Qaeda suicide bomber who was posing as a reformed jihadist. The prince was slightly injured.

The alleged plot revealed Tuesday added to a long list of terror plots with connections to Malaysia, a fast-developing Southeast Asian hub for business and transit that has tried to shake a reputation as a haven for terrorists and illicit activity.

In January 2000, Kuala Lumpur was site of an infamous planning meeting for the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation later calling Malaysia "a primary operational launchpad."

Counterterrorism forces have feared that Islamic State will take root in the region, particularly among the Muslim populations in Indonesia, Malaysia and the southern Philippines. In January 2016, four Indonesian militants with links to Islamic State killed four people in downtown Jakarta. It was the group's first attack in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population.

Malaysia recently was the scene of terrorism of a different sort. On Feb. 13, a hit team killed Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, by smearing his face with a lethal VX nerve agent while he was waited in a crowded airport departures hall. Police believe four North Korean suspects in the murder plot escaped to Pyongyang, while three others are said to be in hiding at the North Korean Embassy.

Malaysia has since revoked visa-free travel for North Koreans and the two countries have expelled each other's ambassadors. Pyongyank is now preventing its Malaysian visitors from leaving North Korea, and Malaysia has imposed the same restrictions on its North Korean tourists.

U.S. News: From  ISIS  to Prosecutors' Aide --- New counterterrorism effort enlists a former recruit to help with early intervention

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn believe they have found a special weapon in their fight against terrorism: a young man named Mo.

Mo, a U.S. citizen whose full name is under seal, left New York City in the summer of 2014 to join Islamic State in Syria. Now 28 years old, Mo quickly became disillusioned, he says now. Four months in, he sent an email to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "Please help me get home," he wrote, according to court documents. "I'm fed up with this evil."

While the FBI was still verifying the email, a civilian smuggler helped Mo escape and reach a U.S. State Department outpost in Turkey.

Authorities in November 2014 deported Mo back to Brooklyn, where he pleaded guilty to two terrorism charges.

Since then, Mo's work with the U.S. government has included an unusual form of cooperation: conducting an intervention with a 15-year-old boy from Brooklyn who was posting tweets that appeared to support violence and Islamic State, also known as ISIS. The intervention so far has successfully dissuaded the teenager from joining the terrorist group. Mo, whose offenses carry a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, will likely be sentenced by a federal judge this summer.

The use of Mo became one catalyst for a new counterterrorism initiative by the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office. The effort is aimed at getting law enforcement to intervene earlier with terror suspects before they take substantial steps toward violence or traveling overseas. It also hopes to connect suspects with mental-health counselors, mentors and defectors like Mo.

The initiative is the brainchild of Seth DuCharme, who leads the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office's national-security and cybercrime unit. As the volume of terrorist-related threats online has grown, Mr. DuCharme said law enforcement needs a new approach for suspects who post worrisome statements but don't yet warrant criminal prosecution.

Islamic State's propaganda videos have been particularly appealing to young people who are loners or have mental-health issues, prosecutors say. Other U.S. jurisdictions have considered so-called "deradicalization" programs, a recognition that some suspects are young enough to turn their lives around.

Prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York have been among the most active in bringing terrorism cases, according to researchers.

"We are not deferring prosecution of terrorists. That notion would be absurd," said Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers.

Under the new initiative, Brooklyn federal prosecutors will also use more discretion before charging someone with providing "material support" to terrorists, a broad violation.

Ironically, the government's initial miscalculation with Mo shows what can go wrong with an early intervention.

FBI agents first confronted Mo at his home in Brooklyn in June 2014.

At the time, Mo, who grew up Muslim in Brooklyn, had dropped out of Columbia University and worked as a cabdriver. In an interview, Mo said he had become increasingly religious and sought answers about Islam online, which led him to terrorist recruiters posing as credible scholars. "I ended up in a bubble because I wasn't going to school," he said.

During the FBI's visit, Mo told the agents he supported groups fighting the Syrian government but lacked the resources to get there, according to the court documents.

One week later, Mo boarded a flight to Istanbul. He said the FBI visit made him realize if he wanted to live under Shariah law, he had to act quickly.

Since Mo's return, he has spent a lot of time assisting prosecutors, such as flagging the deeper meaning behind tweets from Islamic State supporters.

Mo told the government he hoped his cooperation "would prevent him from spending the rest of his life in jail," according to court documents.

Mo said he hopes to keep helping the government turn terror suspects away from Islamic State's ideology. "These are people who don't think killing is wrong and don't think anything of hurting innocent people," he said. "I can't be apathetic to that.

Risks of a Failed

Intervention Give

Skeptics Pause

The new counterterrorism effort represents a gamble for the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office and other agencies involved, including the FBI.

A failed early intervention where a suspect ends up committing a terrorist attack would likely mean the end of the project, officials say. Meanwhile, there are no clear metrics for measuring its success.

"We're taking an incredible amount of risk because we're talking about providing a resource that isn't necessarily what the FBI typically does," one law-enforcement official said.

Skeptics of Brooklyn's initiative say they are uncomfortable giving terrorism suspects the chance to change their behavior before an arrest. Such opportunities aren't typically afforded to gang members, corrupt politicians or other types of criminals, say current and former officials.

A major hurdle for Brooklyn is identifying which suspects are amenable to an early intervention. According to former prosecutors, intervening before an arrest could tip a terror suspect off to government surveillance.

元IS戦闘員をテロ防止の「武器」に　米当局が説得役に活用; 要注意人物のSNS投稿に介入させる

　米ニューヨーク・ブルックリンの連邦検察事務所の関係者は、テロとの戦いで特別な武器を見つけたと考えている。それはモー（Mo）という名の若い男性のことだ。

　モーは28歳の米国市民だ。本名は伏せられている。2014年夏にニューヨーク市を離れ、出国した。シリアで過激派組織「イスラム国（IS）」に加わるためだった。

　現地に到着後、すぐに幻滅したという。裁判書類によると、彼は現地入りして4カ月後に「私の帰国を支援してください」という電子メールを米連邦捜査局（FBI）に送った。「この邪悪さには、もううんざりです」

　FBIがこのメールの真偽の確認を続けている間に、彼は密入国業者の助けで逃亡し、トルコにある米国務省の在外公館にたどり着くことができた。

　当局は14年11月、モーを米国に送還した。彼はブルックリンでテロに関する2件の罪を認めた。ISのために建物の見張り役を務めたこと、他の新戦闘員たちにコンピューターソフトの使い方を教えたことをFBIに明かした。

　それ以来、モーは米政府当局と異例な形で協力している。ブルックリン在住の15歳の少年が暴力やISを支持するような内容をツイートすると、モーが介入した。少年は説得され、今のところISへの参加を思いとどまっている。

　モーは最長25年の禁錮刑に処される可能性がある。連邦裁判所による判決は今夏に下される見通しだ。

　異例な形のモーの活用は、ブルックリンの連邦検察事務所が取り組む新たなテロ対策の契機になった。取り組みの狙いは、従来より早い段階で法執行当局が介入することだ。15歳の少年のようなテロの要注意人物が暴力や海外渡航に向けて大きく踏み出す前に説得する。こうした要注意人物を精神衛生の専門家やメンター（助言者）、モーのようなテロ組織からの離反者に引き合わせることも想定している。

　この取り組みは、ブルックリン検察事務所で国家安全保障・サイバー犯罪部門を率いている元保安官のセス・ドゥシャーム氏が考案した。インターネット上でテロリスト関連の脅威が増大するなか、ソーシャルメディアに怪しげな投稿をするが刑事訴追には相当しない要注意人物がいる。そうした要注意人物に対し、法執行当局は新たなアプローチを必要としているとドゥシャーム氏は語る。

　同連邦検察事務所の標的はグレーゾーンに入る要注意人物だ。ドゥシャーム氏によると、「方向変換し暴力から遠ざかる可能性のある」若者などが対象になる。

　モーとの取り組みはユニークだ。他の地区の検察官らは、IS離反者で信頼できる人や政府当局に協力しようとする人を探すのに苦労していると話す。

　ブルックリン連邦検察にとっての大きなハードルは、早めの介入を受け入れそうな要注意人物を見極めることだ。元検察官らによると、逮捕前の介入は政府が監視していることを要注意人物に知らせることになり、本人は仲間との連絡を暗号化アプリに移行しかねない。

FBIの早期面会は失敗

　皮肉なことに、モーを巡る当局による当初の読み違いは早期介入がうまくいかない場合があることを示している。

　FBIの捜査官は14年6月、ブルックリンの自宅で初めてモーと対面した。ツイッターでの動きから疑念が生じていた。

　同地区でイスラム教徒として育ったモーは当時、コロンビア大学を中退し、学生ローンを返すためタクシー運転手として働いていた。インタビューでは、当時は次第に信仰深くなり、イスラムに関する答えをインターネットに求めていたと述べた。そこで信頼できる学者を装ったテロリスト勧誘者たちに出会ったという。「私は学校に行っていなかったから幻想に中に入り込んでしまった」

　裁判書類によると、彼はFBI捜査官と対面した際、シリア政府と戦っているグループを支持しているが、そこに行くための資金がないと言った。FBI捜査官は彼が脅威ではないと判断し、立ち去った。

　週間後、モーはイスタンブール行きの飛行機に乗っていた。FBI捜査官による自宅訪問を受け、イスラム法の下で生きたいのなら早く行動しなくてはならないと気付いたという。

　Sがテロリスト集団であることを知っていたかと尋ねたところ、彼は懐疑的だったと話した。当時は「あるグループをテロリスト集団にし、別の集団をそうでないとするものは何なのか」と思い巡らせていたという。

　イスタンブールに到着し、国境を渡ってシリアに入国した後は、他の新入りたちと共に生活した。食料はあまりなく、自分の命を常に案じながら、家から家へと転々としていた。ISのメンバーたちが自爆用ベストやその他の暴力行為を正当化していると聞き、「自分の成長と共にあったイスラム」とは種類が違うと感じたという。

　幾度かのインタビューで、モーはしばしば哲学用語を使って話した。彼が関心を抱いたのは「いつ宗教性が急進主義に転じるのか」という問題だったという。

　モーは帰国して以降、検察官への支援に多くの時間を費やしている。IS支持者からのツイートにある隠された意味を知らせるといった作業だ。裁判書類によると、当局に協力することで「残りの人生を刑務所で過ごさなくてもよくなる」ことを願っていると当局者に述べている。

　将来の計画については、テロの要注意人物をISのイデオロギーから解放するという政府の取り組みを支援し続けたいと語った。「彼らは殺人が悪いことだと思っておらず、罪のない人を傷つけることを何とも思っていない連中だ」と述べ、「そのことに私は無関心ではいられない」と話した。

U.S. News: Ex- ISIS  Recruit Aids Prosecutors --- Work includes intervention with teen in effort to head off potential terrorism

Authorities in November 2014 deported Mo back to Brooklyn, where he pleaded guilty to two terrorism charges. He told the FBI that he acted as a building guard for Islamic State and taught other recruits how to use computer software.

Since then, Mo's work with the U.S. government has included an unusual form of cooperation: conducting an intervention with a 15-year-old boy from Brooklyn who was posting tweets that appeared to support violence and Islamic State, also known as ISIS. The intervention so far has successfully dissuaded the teenager from joining the terrorist group.

It also hopes to connect suspects with mental-health counselors, mentors and defectors like Mo.

The initiative is the brainchild of Seth DuCharme, a former marshal who leads the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office's national-security and cybercrime unit. As the volume of terrorist-related threats online has grown, Mr. DuCharme said law enforcement needs a new approach for suspects who post worrisome statements on social media but don't yet warrant criminal prosecution.

Brooklyn's effort is targeted at suspects who fall into a gray area, such as a juvenile "who can potentially be redirected and moved away from violence," Mr. DuCharme said.

Islamic State's flashy propaganda videos have been particularly appealing to young people who are loners or have mental-health issues, prosecutors say. Other U.S. jurisdictions have considered so-called "deradicalization" programs, a recognition that some suspects are young enough to turn their lives around without decades in prison.

Brooklyn's work with Mo is unique, as prosecutors in other districts say they have struggled to find Islamic State defectors who can be trusted or are willing to work with the government.

Prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York, which includes Brooklyn, have been among the most active in bringing terrorism cases, publicly charging 16 Islamic State sympathizers since 2014, according to researchers.

"We are not deferring prosecution of terrorists. That notion would be absurd," said Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers. "Where prosecution . . . is appropriate, our office has a robust record for holding terrorists accountable."

Under the new initiative, Brooklyn federal prosecutors will also use more discretion before charging someone with providing "material support" to terrorists, a broad violation that carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. Prosecutors may try to arrest some individuals on a lesser charge without the terrorism stigma, such as wire fraud.

For suspects already in custody, prosecutors will give more consideration to a shorter prison sentence in exchange for a longer period of supervised release that includes counseling or treatment.

Prosecutors are proceeding cautiously, saying they expect no more than a handful of suspects to be part of the effort in the first year.

The effort represents a gamble for the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office and other agencies involved, including the FBI. A failed early intervention where a suspect ends up committing a terrorist attack would likely mean the end of the project, officials say.

A major hurdle for Brooklyn is identifying which suspects are amenable to an early intervention. According to former prosecutors, intervening before an arrest could tip a terror suspect off to government surveillance and encourage the suspect to move communications to encrypted apps.

Ironically, the government's initial miscalculation with Mo shows what can go wrong with an early intervention.

FBI agents first confronted Mo at his home in Brooklyn in June 2014, after his activity on Twitter aroused suspicion.

At the time, Mo, who grew up Muslim in Brooklyn, had dropped out of Columbia University and worked as a cabdriver to pay off his student loans. In an interview, Mo said he had become increasingly religious and sought answers about Islam online, which led him to terrorist recruiters posing as credible scholars. "I ended up in a bubble because I wasn't going to school," he said.

During the FBI's visit, Mo told the agents he supported groups fighting the Syrian government but lacked the resources to get there, according to the court documents. The agents left, thinking Mo wasn't a threat.

One week later, Mo boarded a flight to Istanbul. He said the FBI visit made him realize if he wanted to live under Shariah law, he had to act quickly.

When asked whether he knew Islamic State was a terrorist group, Mo said he was skeptical. "What makes one group a terrorist group and another one not?" he said he wondered at the time.

After reaching Istanbul and crossing the border to Syria, Mo said he lived with the other recruits without much food, constantly fearing for his life and moving from house to house. He heard Islamic State members justify suicide vests and other violent acts that he knew didn't comport with "the type of Islam I grew up with."

During several interviews, Mo spoke frequently in philosophical terms, saying he was interested in the question of when "religiosity crosses over into radicalism." The government declined to comment on Mo's conditions of confinement.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Suspected militants linked to Islamic State were stopped just short of attacking Saudi royals during King Salman's recent trip here, Malaysian police said.

"We got them in the nick of time," Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said. Three teams of militants had planned attacks on the Saudis, he said, but he declined to give details. One group comprised four Yemenis, another an Indonesian and a Malaysian, and a third a man from an unspecified East Asian nation.

Malaysia, without identifying the targets, said the plotters were arrested between Feb. 21 and Feb. 26. Police said two of the men were directed by Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, a Malaysian who joined Islamic State in Syria in 2015, in preparing a car bomb. The Indonesian arrested had previously been deported to Turkey after trying to enter Syria, police said.

Police said the East Asian suspect, believed to have been living in Malaysia on a student visa since 2011, had suspected links to a regional terrorist group that uses Malaysia as a transit point and safe haven.

The Saudi king is on a monthlong tour of Asia to strengthen ties with a region the kingdom sees as a valuable economic partner and a hedge against an unpredictable U.S. government. Malaysia was the first stop.

World News: Generals Seek to Curb Friendly Fire

The U.S. military's top officer met with his Russian and Turkish counterparts on Tuesday, seeking to avoid conflict among forces allied with the three countries as they converge on the Syrian battlefield.

The meeting of Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov and Turkish Gen. Hulusi Akar in Antalya, Turkey, follows calls to improve communications after a number of deaths in what were deemed friendly-fire incidents.

It was scheduled last week after a Russian airstrike near Manbij hit Syrian forces trained by the U.S., according to a person familiar with the situation.

The U.S.-led military coalition fighting Islamic State has boosted its presence in and around Manbij, which was wrested from the extremist group's control last summer by U.S.-backed Arab and Kurdish forces.

The military chiefs met to improve communications at the senior level and to avoid interference among the military operations, Gen. Dunford's office said.

In a statement released Tuesday evening, the U.S. and Turkish militaries said the participants "discussed regional security matters in Syria and Iraq, specifically the current situation of the fight against all terrorist organizations in Syria with an effort to wage a more effective fight against all terrorist organizations in the future."

The countries support sometimes opposing parties in Syria's multisided conflict, now in its sixth year. As the campaign to eradicate Islamic State ramps up, their aims and operations have increasingly come into conflict.

Military protocols exist for communications between U.S. and Russian officers and between Turkish and Russian officers to coordinate air operations and bombing operations, but the fluidity of the battlefield and tensions between proxies in Syria have led to mistakes, U.S. and Turkish officials say.

Last month, an errant Russian airstrike called in by its pro-government Syrian allies killed three Turkish soldiers fighting to capture the town of al-Bab from Islamic State.

U.S. and Turkish officials described previous incidents as friendly-fire accidents and called for better communications to prevent similar occurrences.

Relations between Moscow and Washington have been chilly, but Gens. Dunford and Gerasimov met last month in Baku, Azerbaijan, the highest-level military-to-military contact between the two countries since January 2014.

The discussions about the situation on the ground follow efforts to avoid incidents in the skies over Syria among U.S., coalition and Russian aircraft. A U.S. airstrike in September in Deir Ezzour, Syria, that mistakenly killed Syrian forces also created major strain between Moscow and Washington.

At present, the U.S. and Russia have military dialogue under a memorandum of understanding signed in 2015. That agreement doesn't include the sharing or coordination of intelligence, something U.S. defense officials are quick to say isn't under consideration. It has, however, mandated a series of exchanges to ensure jet fighters and other aircraft don't hit each other.

But as aircraft operations over Syria increase, U.S. military officials say they see greater chances an air mishap could occur.

The U.S. has also faced tensions with Turkey over its backing of the YPG, Syrian Kurdish fighters the Pentagon views as the most capable local forces. Ankara sees them as an arm of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a group that has fought for independence in southeastern Turkey.

U.S. Air Force Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, said the U.S.-backed coalition's moves around Manbij aimed to "deter hostile acts, enhance governance and ensure there's no persistent YPG presence."

The coalition, Col. Dorrian added, "has taken this deliberate action to reassure coalition members and partner forces, deter aggression and keep focus on defeating ISIS."

Early last year, agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation showed up at Nephetia Brown's home in Brooklyn's East New York neighborhood with some alarming news.

They said her son, now 15 years old, was tweeting about Islamic State's violent ideologies. He may be on his way to jail, they told her.

But instead of arresting her son, FBI agents decided to try a novel approach. They asked him to undergo an intervention with an Islamic State defector named Mo.

Mo's intervention with T.—he first initial of the teenager's name—as proved successful, for now.

In New York, the FBI monitors hundreds of potential terror suspects every day, and some pro-Islamic State posts online have been traced to kids as young as elementary-school age, one official said. Officials are wrestling with how to deal with minors like T. who support Islamic State on social media but haven't yet committed any violence or crimes.

The intervention involving Mo and T. is being lauded by officials as a potential future model for dealing with young terror suspects who don't warrant prosecution. Some officials have called the intervention unprecedented, and it represents an important test case as law-enforcement officials in Brooklyn embark on a new counterterrorism program aimed at intervening earlier with terrorism suspects.

When the FBI agents showed up at Ms. Brown's house, the 36-year-old electrical apprentice was shocked. Ms. Brown, who is Christian, knew her son had begun converting to Islam in middle school, but she hadn't found anything unusual when she monitored his online activities.

According to Ms. Brown, the FBI told her that for several months, using aliases, T. had been tweeting about Islamic State, saying he wanted to "take part in an act" and "help the cause."

"I guess I wasn't looking for the right thing or in the right place," Ms. Brown said. "I was disappointed with myself because it happened right in my house."

She told the FBI that her son's online persona didn't reflect who he really was. Her son had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and depression, she said. He had few friends, and the online following he gained by tweeting about Islamic State may have given him a sense of acceptance, she said.

During the first visit, the FBI spent three hours interrogating Ms. Brown and her son. After hearing about T.'s psychological issues and seeing his family situation, the FBI decided not to arrest him. Agents still visit his home every few months.

An FBI agent coordinated the intervention between T. and Mo, partly because the agent thought the two had similar backgrounds. Mo, who also grew up in Brooklyn, joined Islamic State in Syria in 2014 but escaped a few months later. He has since returned to the U.S. and is cooperating with the government.

The intervention happened last July in a bright, windowless conference room at the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office.

T. showed up with only his mother. As everyone in the room ate pizza, Mo tried to bond with T. "You know that crazy guy who comes on the 2 train and nobody makes eye contact with him?" Mo said, according to people at the intervention. "Everyone in ISIS is far worse than that guy."

Initially, T. sat quietly. But he opened up when Mo asked him to name his favorite propaganda video. T. said he liked a video in which Islamic State soldiers are shown picking up garbage and helping women and children in Syria. Mo replied that he saw for himself how the propaganda videos were all lies.

T. began to pepper Mo with questions. For over an hour, Mo picked apart his assumptions about Islamic State, describing the harsh reality of living in Syria.

As the meeting ended, Ms. Brown cried and hugged the agents, who asked T. to write an essay describing what he took away from the intervention.

Since then, T. hasn't taken any steps toward violence, but he is still on a bumpy path. A few weeks after the intervention, T. regained access to his cellphone, which had been confiscated by his mother. He immediately started tweeting again about Islamic State and hasn't been able to use a phone ever since. T.'s only access to a computer is at his high school in Brooklyn, where he is in 10th grade.

"This effort requires constant vigilance," said Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers, referring to T.'s case. "We are ready to take law enforcement action if the subject makes a wrong turn."

There are signs of progress, too. He has a 78% grade point average, joined the filmmaking club at school and wants to go to college, according to Ms. Brown. Weekly therapy sessions have helped him become more outgoing and less emotional, she said.

It isn't clear how long FBI agents will continue to monitor T. They check in with his progress at school and have taken him to a Dave & Buster's restaurant, Ms. Brown said. She said she feels the agents have become part of her family.

During this period, Ms. Brown also separated from her husband and was raising two other sons below the age of 6. Ms. Brown said the family turmoil was one reason T. felt ignored and turned to the internet for attention.

Ms. Brown says she sometimes still worries about T. running away from home. In her mind, the teen will be risk-free when she no longer has concerns about him being near a computer.

"I take it a day at a time," she said. "It's unfortunate that it's happened, but the only thing we can do is move forward."

The expanding threat of cyberattacks on U.S. government and business interests is of increasing concern to officials responsible for our nation's security. Gerald Seib, The Wall Street Journal's executive Washington editor, discussed the threats and efforts to counter them with former U.S. Chief Information Security Officer Gregory Touhill, and James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Edited excerpts follow.

MR. SEIB: Rank the threat from state actors. Who does it come from? What does it constitute? What's the scariest aspect of it right now?

MR. TOUHILL: If you'd asked me that about three years ago, I would've said that Russia was much higher than anybody else. However, over the last three years, I've seen some evidence that indicates that while Russia remains extremely potent in their capabilities, actors such as those located in China have closed that gap. We've seen Iran and North Korea really step up their game as well. I would put those four nation-state entities in a bucket that would cause me great concern.

MR. WOOLSEY: I think it's the linkage between technology and ideology that creates the biggest problems. Russia and China are a problem. China in the South China Sea, Russia because it keeps expanding and grabbing countries. But those are states we kind of know how to deal with. I would focus most on ISIS, North Korea and Iran as places where ideology is coming together with the availability of technology.

MR. SEIB: The people who have the capability, the nation-state actors who want to engage in hacking, what's their motivation these days?

MR. TOUHILL: As a War College graduate, I've got to tell you, the answer is always going to be, "It depends." One could make a great argument that ideology and trying to preserve the brand and reputation of the North Korean regime may have been a motivator behind the Sony hack.

If you look at some of the hacks attributed to Chinese actors, with the widespread theft of intellectual property from American business, you could make the case that they are trying to seek a competitive advantage in the marketplace. In the traditional military intelligence and reconnaissance activities, we've seen that throughout both public and private sectors from nation-state actors.

If you look at some of the things we're seeing from criminal actors that are arguably linked to state sponsors, there's hints that it's definitely a correlation between some criminal activity and state sponsorship. There's a blending of motivations there.

At the end of the day, though, the vandals, the burglars, the muggers, the spies, the saboteurs -- you have to protect against all of them based on your risk appetite.

MR. SEIB: There are critical infrastructure systems, too -- power grids, energy systems. And there's not just computer hacking, there are electromagnetic-pulse threats.

MR. WOOLSEY: Absolutely. As the Internet of Things evolves into the Internet of Everything, if you take out one part of it, you can take out cascading parts. We have no single authority in the U.S. government that's responsible for the electric grid and fixing it and building resilience into it, short of the president. And we have then a condition that makes it possible, really plausible, for hacking. Or an electromagnetic pulse.

The commission on the electromagnetic pulse that looked at this seven years ago, chaired by Ronald Reagan's science adviser, Dr. Bill Graham, had two estimates for the loss of life if you lose the electric grid in the U.S. over I think it was a five-year period. One was that you lost two-thirds of the population to disease and social disruption and so forth. The more troubling estimate was you lost 90% of the American population.

MR. SEIB: Is the government in a position to help businesses with cyberattacks? Does it know how to help?

MR. TOUHILL: Yes, we can help. But it is a shared responsibility under our laws, and our value system. If you take a look at cybersecurity as a risk-management issue, collectively we want to buy down the risk for our citizens. But we don't necessarily have an appetite for the government to come out to the private sector and say, "This is your risk level that you've got to maintain." We don't want to stifle innovation, we don't want to stifle the ability of folks to take chances and run their businesses.

We've offered through the government improved information sharing, so if we see something, we say something. I think it's important that the federal government shares information that's actionable. We've seen some improvements in some of the information sharing, but we have a long way to go. We also need to keep an eye on how we share information with whom.

There's a lot of technology solutions. We came up with a machine-to-machine information-sharing mechanism called STIX, for Structured Threat Information Expression, and TAXII, the Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information, a means of disseminating the threat information.

But not everybody has the ability to set up a STIX and TAXII server. We still need to have the ability to communicate with small and medium businesses. We've been working with the different sector coordinating councils and critical infrastructure. And we even set up a program called the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services, where, working with a lot of the internet service providers, we shared with them material so they could set up a secured capability to filter all that crap out before it even got to their downstream customers.

That needs to probably be promoted a little bit more. And then we believe that by helping knock down some of that stuff that could come downstream to the small and medium businesses and the folks in their households, we can focus more on the important actors out there. We need to cut down some of the chaff.

モスル奪還作戦、発見されたIS精鋭「訓練キャンプ」 射撃練習場、障害コース、モスク、診療所を完備

　【モスル（イラク）】過激派組織「イスラム国（IS）」はイラクの主要拠点だったモスル近くの廃トンネル内に、新兵を訓練して精鋭に鍛え上げるための障害物コースを設けていた。有刺鉄線の下をくぐり、壁をよじ登るなどの訓練を施したもようだ。モスル奪還作戦に従事するイラク軍が発見した。

　シリアの遺跡都市にちなんで「パルミラ」と名付けられたこの訓練キャンプは、イラク北部の都市モスル郊外の古い列車トンネル内にあり、長さは1.6キロメートル以上に及ぶ。トンネル内は大がかりに改造され、障害物コースや射撃練習場、シャワー、医療施設などが完備されていた。

　イラク軍のアブドゥル・アメール広報官は「テロリスト集団（＝IS）最大のキャンプの一つだ」と述べ、150人以上の新兵がここで同時に訓練できたのではないかと推測した。

　広報官は「明らかにこのキャンプは精鋭部隊や外国人兵士の訓練に使われた施設だ」と述べた。「これまでに発見したキャンプとは全く違う」

　施設を見ると、新兵がいかに肉体的苦痛と「洗脳」を織り交ぜた過酷な訓練を受けたかがうかがえる。彼らはここでカリフ（予言者ムハンマドの後継者）を最高指導者とする「カリフ制国家」を防衛するという戦士の使命を吹き込まれたのだ。

　廃トンネル中央の小さなモスクには、ISが作成した宗教に関するテキストやIS発行の新聞が床に散らばっていた。これらの印刷物は新兵がISの哲学だけに触れる環境を作る狙いがあった。カリフ制国家のための戦いを正当化し、必要ならば命をささげるという哲学だ。

　重要な施設を失ったことは、米軍主導の有志連合が支援するモスル奪還作戦が進むにつれ、ISの領土維持が一段と難しくなったことを印象づける。イラク軍は1月下旬、モスルのチグリス川東側の地域を制圧した。破壊されたインフラの建設がすでに始まり、店舗が営業を再開するなど住民は以前の生活を取り戻そうとしている。

　ここ数日はイラク軍がISと市街戦を繰り広げた。2日にはイラク軍がモスル西部で狙撃兵の隠れ家を突き止めた。携行式ロケット弾を3発打ち込んだが効果はなく、さらに大量の無反動式砲で爆破したところ、狙撃兵の発砲がやんだ。

　Sのモスル地区指導者の「アブ・サリム」であるとイラク軍が特定した戦士は、中庭付近で死亡していた。遺体は足を格子柄のスカーフで縛られており、ISの衛生兵が止血に失敗したとみられる。

　イラク軍関係者によると、モスルの最後の抗戦に加わった戦士の少なくとも一部は「パルミラ」キャンプで訓練を受けた公算が大きい。

　廃トンネルの両端には大量の土嚢が積み上げられ、予想される空爆に備えていたもようだ。障害物コースには、市街戦の基礎を教えるための小さな家の模型もあった。コースの端にある看板は、その先にカラシニコフ自動小銃「AK47」の射撃場があることを示していた。

Man Accused of Trying to Join  ISIS

Federal prosecutors accused a Long Island man of attempting to provide material support to terrorists, according to a complaint unsealedover the weekend.

Prosecutors said Elvis Redzepagic, 26 years old, traveled twice to the Middle East and made attempts to join Islamic State and the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate.

Mr. Redzepagic appeared in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Saturday. Federal agents arrested him at his home in Commack, N.Y., the day before, authorities said.

"This defendant made numerous attempts to travel to Syria to wage violent jihad," Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers said in a statement. "We will continue to track down and prosecute individuals like the defendant before they are able to become foreign fighters or harm the United States and its allies."

Mildred Whalen, a lawyer for Mr. Redzepagic, said her client had been fully cooperative with law enforcement. "We will be working with his family in the hope that the court and the government will see that what he needs is counseling and support, not imprisonment," Ms. Whalen said.

Mr. Redzepagic, a U.S. citizen, traveled to Turkey in July 2015 because he wanted to join his cousin, who he believed was the commander of a battalion in Syria, according to the complaint.Mr. Redzepagic wasn't able to cross the border from Turkey to Syria so he left the country, the complaint says. He told law-enforcement officials that when he tried to enter Syria, "he was prepared to strap a bomb on and sacrifice himself for jihad," according to the complaint.

In October 2015, Mr. Redzepagic sent messages from his Facebook account, writing, according to the complaint: "since i got back from turkey from trying to perform Jihad and join Jabhat Al Nusra the cia has been bothering me" and "Its annoying but i out smarted them."

In August 2016, he traveled to Jordan to cross into Syria, but Jordanian officials sent him back to the U.S., the complaint says.

Mr. Redzepagic was arrested by Suffolk County police officers in early February on a violation, according to the complaint. It says he voluntarily participated in interviews with law-enforcement officials, including providing his laptop and cellphone to investigators.

His attorney requested a bail hearing in federal court in Central Islipon Monday, a court spokesman said.

Houses of Worship
A Suicide Bomber and the Sufi Soul

By Iman Malik

Thousands of worshipers were gathered at a prominent Sufi shrine in Sehwan, Pakistan, last month when a suicide bomb ripped through the courtyard, killing more than 80. As a counterterrorism analyst, I had long expected that something terrible would happen at the site -- the mausoleum of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, revered as a Sufi saint. And I wasn't surprised that an Islamic State affiliate quickly claimed responsibility for the bombing. But as a human and a Muslim who practices Sufism, it wrenched my heart.

Many Westerners today associate Islam with the doctrinaire tradition of Salafi jihadism, embodied by organizations like ISIS and al Qaeda. Yet Islam is so far from monolithic that sectarian differences often lead to violence and hatred among Muslims. Islamic State attacked the shrine precisely because of its importance to adherents of Sufism.

Sufism is an esoteric, mystical dimension of Islam whose adherents focus on maintaining a direct, personal relationship with God. It isn't a sect. Rather, Sufism is an approach to understanding Islam. Sufis seek conciliation, rather than confrontation, among all religions. They can be found throughout the world, and Sufism is apolitical. Its adherents are on a quest not for temporal power but for self-knowledge and an understanding of the divine. To Sufis, all those who believe in a higher power and divine connection are Sufis.

Lal Shahbaz Qalandar is one of Sufism's most important figures. Born during the 12th century in what is now Afghanistan, he traveled extensively, seeking spiritual guidance before ensconcing himself in Sehwan. A poet and philosopher, he spent his life preaching and writing. Devotees visit his shrine to satisfy their social and physical needs, but also to find spiritual enlightenment. People bring red and green shawls with Quranic calligraphy in silver and gold threads, along with tributes for their votive offerings.

Many of those killed and wounded last month were performing a devotional ritual of "dhamaal," an ecstatic and coordinated swirl of the head and body that represents a spiritual ascent through the mind to God's love. The lights on the shrine's trees and walls, the crimson hues of oil lamps and candles, and the smell of incense sticks sedate the divine lovers as they whirl faster and faster. Drums, bells, gongs, horns and cymbals make a deafening cacophony.

The devotees believe their prayers are answered and their wounds are healed -- that spiritual guidance is sought and solace is attained. The shrine symbolizes the tolerant, pluralistic and syncretic essence of Islam. All people are the creation of one God, and the connection to the divine is direct, serene and pious.

Salafi jihadism is associated with literal, puritanical and political approaches to Islam. It employs guilt and fear as motivators. Sufism, on the other hand, embodies love and kindness: Obedience to God should come not from fear of hell, but from a desire to be closer to Him. Sufism attests that God has created man with a mind and a free will. It accepts the existence of anti-Islamic authorities and does not seek to replace them by force.

Sufism and its pluralistic tenets are embedded in Pakistani society, but they have been targeted systematically for decades. Former President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, a hard-line Deobandi Sunni who ruled for more than a decade, infested the country with a program of Islamization and sowed the seeds of extremism. Over the decades, Pakistan has been disfigured as the lines blurred between national and Islamist politics, and as good governance gave way to a fixation on the rivalry with India and the military's narrative of patriotism.

Islamabad's policy of "good and bad" jihadi proxies -- in which the military establishment considers some elements of the Taliban good, and others bad -- has made the situation worse and paved the way for splinter groups. This in turn provided space to those who seek to import one of the most lethal versions of global jihad, that espoused by ISIS. Officials at the country's National Counter Terrorism Authority had previously denied the presence of ISIS in Pakistan. Yet last month, the world witnessed the truth as ISIS turned worshipers of love into dust.

No attack, however, can shatter the Sufi soul, which is free from the dimensions of time and space. "We are having Dhammal this evening as it has continued each evening since centuries," a descendant of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar told me in a phone call shortly after the attack. I could hear the music and the beating of Middle Eastern drums in the background. "My message from the shrine," he added, "is of love, humanity, peace and tolerance."

World News: Syrian Troops Retake Palmyra From  ISIS  --- Loss of historic city is one in a series of setbacks for Islamic State since 2015

Russian-backed Syrian government troops on Thursday recaptured the historic city of Palmyra from Islamic State for the second time, the Syrian army said in a statement.

Islamic State fighters planted mines and explosives -- a common tactic used by the extremist group as it is pushed back in its Syrian and Iraqi strongholds -- as they fled the advance, according to the army and the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition monitoring group. The troops were supported by Russian warplanes, they said.

The loss of Palmyra, a Unesco World Heritage site home to some of the region's oldest and most venerated historic sites, is the latest military setback for Islamic State. It has lost a number of key battles since 2015 and is now fighting for control of Mosul, its remaining urban stronghold in Iraq. Turkish-backed rebels last month also captured the northern Syrian city of al-Bab from the group.

Islamic State had retaken Palmyra in December 2016, in what was seen as a resounding embarrassment for President Bashar al-Assad's forces and their Russian ally, after having driven the militants from the city that March.

The regime's second loss of Palmyra came in December as its forces, aided by foreign Shiite Muslim militias, had been slowly regaining control of the city of Aleppo after months of intense fighting.

Even bolstered by domestic militias and thousands of foreign fighters, it has struggled to maintain a force capable of battling opposition rebels and Islamic State on multiple fronts.

Thursday's victory carries military and symbolic significance for the regime and key ally Moscow, both of whom have claimed to be fighting terrorism in Syria.

"The liberation of Palmyra is a powerful symbol of Syria's liberation from the infection of terrorism," Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the upper house of the Russian parliament's committee on foreign affairs, told the country's Interfax news agency.

Russia began backing Syrian forces in October 2015, with the goal of defeating terrorist groups in Syria. It has been accused, including by Western officials, of using air power mainly to attack the more moderate rebel groups seeking to overthrow Mr. Assad.

Recapturing Palmyra "proves that the Syrian Arab Army in cooperation with [its] friends is the only effective force capable of countering and eradicating terrorism," the Syrian army said in its statement.

Syria's army "will continue to fight terrorism, specifically Daesh," said Talal al-Barazi, the governor of Homs province, where Palmyra is located.

The seizure of the historic site caused global outrage and concern about the fate of the ruins, including many statues and temples which Islamic State militants believe are forbidden by their extreme interpretation of Islam.

Islamic State first seized Palmyra in May 2015.

Before the Syrian army's first recapture of the city, the militants had blown up parts of its historic landscape and destroyed the more than 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel, one of the region's most revered historic sites.

The destruction continued in their second hold on Palmyra. In January, they destroyed two of its ancient columns and parts of the revered Roman Theater, according to Palmyra Monitor, a group of independent activists based in Turkey.

Islamic State's territorial foothold in Syria still includes large parts of the provinces of Raqqa -- its de facto capital -- and the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzour, where it is besieging the Syrian army.

House Lawmakers Agree to Scope of Russia Investigation; Panel will look at any contacts between U.S. political campaigns and Russia, as well as sources of leaks of classified information

House lawmakers have come to a bipartisan agreement on the scope of a congressional probe into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The House Intelligence Committee said Wednesday evening that it will examine the extent of the Russian cyber activity directed at the U.S., as well as the U.S. government response to those attempted intrusions.

The panel will also look at any links between U.S. political campaigns and the Russian government, as well as the possible sources of leaks of classified information from within the U.S. government.

The agreement is a breakthrough for one of the primary investigations of the matter. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting its own review and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting a separate criminal investigation.

The scope of the House investigation represents a compromise between Republicans and Democrats, who have each focused on different aspects of the controversy surrounding potential foreign interference in the election. A joint report from the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russians intervened using a combination of computer hacking and propaganda on behalf of then-candidate Donald Trump, an assertion that he has rejected.

Mr. Trump has called for an investigation into the numerous leaks of classified information surrounding the investigation since he took office in January.

Democrats have focused more on the potential links between members of Mr. Trump's campaign or senior staff who may have had contact with the Russian government or intelligence operatives.

U.S. investigators have also examined possible contacts that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had with Russian officials when he was serving as an adviser to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, The Wall Street Journal reported this week.

The expanded scope of the probe means that it will include leaks that may have been aimed at undermining the Trump administration, such as those that led to the resignation of Mr. Trump's first national security adviser, as well as possible contact between political actors and foreign governments.

"President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea. At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with Russia, unlike previous administrations, so that we can solve many problems together facing the world, such as the threat of ISIS and terrorism," White House press secretary Sean Spicer has said.

Syria Talks Face Hurdle—.S. Disengagement; Finding a political solution is challenging while the Trump administration is weighing its approach to the war

GENEVA—eace talks between Syria's regime and opposition face a formidable obstacle: Until President Donald Trump's administration decides how to approach the six-year war, it makes little sense for anyone to compromise.

"It's very difficult to reach any political solution if there is not a positive, active and serious role of the U.S.A.," said Nasr Alhariri, head of the opposition delegation to the current round of talks now under way in Geneva.

After all, President Bashar al-Assad's regime holds out hope that Mr. Trump's eagerness to mend fences with Russia will lead Washington to further curtail support for the rebels.

The mostly Sunni opposition, meanwhile, counts on Mr. Trump's desire to roll back Iran, Mr. Assad's key backer that has flooded the country with Shiite militias from Lebanon, Iraq and beyond and that also backs Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Amid conflicting signals from Washington on what the actual policy toward Syria will be and when it will be formulated, both sides are for now united in wooing Mr. Trump.

"Personally I was very glad about the victory of Mr. Trump and the Republicans," said Mohammed Aloush, chief of the Islamist rebel group Army of Islam. "I believe they have the ability to bring change. Mr. Trump has stated that he will limit the role of Iran and the Syrian revolution is the largest test for limiting Iran and for pushing it back to its own borders, away from Beirut, away from San'a and away from Damascus."

Mr. Assad, meanwhile, told Yahoo News last month that he would welcome American participation in the fight against terrorism in Syria if it is done in coordination with his government. He even appeared to support Mr. Trump's controversial travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries including Syria.

While former President Barack Obama's administration micromanaged the largely fruitless Syrian peace process, with Secretary of State John Kerry personally engaging in the minutiae of negotiations, the Trump administration has so far stayed aloof. It sent only the U.S. ambassador in Kazakhstan to talks in Astana in late January. The U.S. special envoy for Syria Michael Ratney attended the first days of the Geneva talks as an observer, and the American role here so far has been largely limited to taking notes—eaving the playing field to the Russians, diplomats say.

A review of the U.S. campaign against Islamic State ordered by the White House is expected to bring more clarity about the overall American approach to Syria in coming weeks. "The U.S. remains committed to any process that can result in a political resolution to the Syrian crisis, which can bring about a more representative, peaceful, and united Syria, free of terrorism and violent extremism," a State Department official said.

Meanwhile, the fact that Russia has turned into the principal power broker of the Syrian conflict has become largely accepted by the Syrian opposition. Rebel negotiators say they have detected a new desire by Moscow to find a political resolution now that the regime's strategic objective of seizing the rebel-held half of Aleppo, the country's biggest city, has been achieved.

"We know that Iran is our enemy and that the Shiite militias that try to change the demographics of Syria are our enemy. I don't think that Russia is OK with that and, at the end of the day, the Russians are not sectarian and want to end the war at the negotiating table," said Hind Kabawat, a member of the opposition delegation in Geneva. "If the Russians can force the regime to sit down and talk transition of power, then why not have the Russians as our partners?"

The question, however, is to what extent can Moscow actually control the behavior of the Assad regime—specially if the U.S. remains disengaged.

Immediately after the Astana talks, Syrian opposition leaders and commanders were enthusiastic about local cease-fire deals negotiated with Moscow. Since then, however, many of these agreements collapsed, often because Iranian-backed Shiite militias refused to honor them.

"The Russians have a lack of ability to deliver because the regime has a lack of ability to rein in these militias," said Free Syrian Army Maj. Issam el-Reyes, a military commander in southern Syria and an adviser to the opposition's Geneva delegation.

That's why even Moscow is troubled by the low level of American involvement in the Syrian peace process.

"The influence of Russia is not limitless on either side of the conflict, be it the government or the opposition," said Yelena Suponina, Middle East specialist at the Russian Institute of Strategic Studies, a state-run think tank in Moscow. "To achieve anything, we need to cooperate with the Americans, and I think, on their part, they could have gotten up to speed a bit faster. We have heard good rhetoric from Trump, but so far have seen no concrete actions."

Bassma Kodmani, a member of the opposition's negotiating team, put in differently.

"Bashar, backed by Iran, is resisting Russian pressures. And the Russians alone cannot fight the Iranians because they have roughly the same strength," she explained. "That's where the absence of America becomes very problematic."

Le Pen Stripped of Immunity in  ISIS  Twitter Case; French presidential candidate's immunity from prosecution is waived over her tweeting of images of Islamic State executions

Marine Le Pen is the leader of France's National Front. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated she is head of the National Party. (March 2, 2017)

BRUSSELS—uropean lawmakers voted Thursday to strip French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen of her immunity from prosecution over her tweeting of images of Islamic State executions.

As a member of the European Parliament, Ms. Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front, is exempt from prosecution. But French prosecutors requested a waiver last year after she tweeted three images in 2015 of Islamic State executions, including the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley.

Under French law, disseminating violent imagery that can be seen by minors is a crime punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of €5,000 ($78,850).

A "broad majority" of the European Parliament voted in Brussels to lift Ms. Le Pen's immunity, said Greek lawmaker Dimitrios Papadimoulis, a parliamentary vice president who presided over the vote.

Polish independent lawmaker Janusz Korwin-Mikke warned before the vote that lifting Ms. Le Pen's immunity would reap political benefits for her in France's elections this spring.

"She will get additional hundreds of thousands of votes. She will pose as persecuted by the bureaucracy and win the elections," he said.

Ms. Le Pen couldn't immediately be reached for comment. In response to angry reactions from the Foley family and French politicians immediately after the Islamic State-related tweets, she said that she was merely "showing the reality of Daesh"—n Arabic acronym for the militant group.

Thursday's vote in the European Union's legislature is likely to add fuel to claims by her supporters that the timing and substance of separate legal moves against her in France and in Brussels are politically motivated.

The latest polls place Ms. Le Pen ahead of all other candidates in the first round of voting on April 23, but they suggest she would lose the runoff two weeks later.

It wasn't the first time the European Parliament has taken such action against the 48-year-old Ms. Le Pen for controversial remarks.

In 2013, her parliamentary immunity was removed over her remarks at a rally in the city of Lyon comparing Muslims praying in the streets to wartime Nazi occupation.

In that case, the waiver request from France's justice ministry came when local prosecutors opened an investigation for incitement of racial hatred after an antiracism group filed a complaint against Ms. Le Pen for her comments. The case went to trial and she was acquitted in December 2015.

A third immunity-waiver request to European Parliament involving Ms. Le Pen is pending. It relates to a defamation case brought against her by the mayor of Nice, whom she accused in May 2015 of funding Islamic organizations in France.

Separately, French and EU authorities are investigating Ms. Le Pen for fraud and misuse of EU funds. No immunity waiver has been requested in those inquiries, a European Parliament spokeswoman said.

However, Ms. Le Pen's parliamentary salary was cut after she declined to repay €00,000 to the EU after an internal parliamentary inquiry found she had misused EU funds.

　【ワシントン】トランプ政権は、イラクを入国禁止対象から除外することを決定した。両国政府の間では、入国禁止によって過激派組織「イスラム国（IS）」の掃討に向けた重要な同盟にひびが入るとの懸念が強まっていた。

　ドナルド・トランプ米大統領が、テロ攻撃への懸念を理由にイラクを含むイスラム圏7カ国からの移民や難民の入国を一時禁止する大統領令に署名した後、イラクや米国防総省から反対の声が高まっていた。米連邦控訴裁判所は、この大統領令の施行差し止めを支持し、トランプ政権は新たな大統領令を検討している。

　イラクが入国禁止対象から除外されたことで、同地域での懸念が緩和するほか、IS掃討作戦で米軍主導の有志連合の一員として戦っているイラクの国民を締め出すのは間違っているとの米国内の不満も和らぐ可能性がある。

　ドナルド・トランプ米大統領の今年の議会演説と、バラク・オバマ前大統領が昨年行った同様な演説にひとつ違いがあった。過激派組織「イスラム国」を指す言葉が「ISIL」から「ISIS」になったことだ。

　トランプ氏は2月28日の演説で、「ISISを破壊する計画を策定する」よう国防総省に指示したと述べた。自身の言葉を使ってイスラム国の最も一般的な略称を後押しした形だ。2014年初めに台頭したイスラム国は「ISIL」「ダーイシュ」とも呼ばれている。

　同組織自体が米政権の交代に合わせて名称を変えたわけではない。では、ホワイトハウスの表現はなぜ変わったのか。結局は個人的な感覚によるものだが、政治もいくらか影響している。

　トランプ氏は大統領選での演説や就任直後の覚え書きでISISという言葉を使った。国防総省は先月、この覚え書きと国防総省の指針を挙げ、イスラム国の以前の名称「イラクとシリアのイスラム国（Islamic State of Iraq and Syria）」の略称であるISISを使うことが望ましいとの指針を職員に示した。

　オバマ氏は大統領時代、ISISほど使われていないISILにこだわった。例えば昨年1月の一般教書演説では、「アルカイダそして今ではISILも、米国民に直接の脅威を与えている」と述べている。

　オバマ政権は、ISILがアラビア語からの翻訳としてより正確だとの考えからこの言葉を使った。レバント（シリア、レバノン、イスラエル、ヨルダンを含む地中海東岸の地域）の頭文字Lを取り入れることで、直接シリアを連想させることを避けるメリットもあった。オバマ政権はシリア内戦に神経をとがらせていた。

　ややこしいことに、イスラム国が14年6月に名称を現在のものに変え、イラクとアルシャーム（シリアと周辺地域を指す）の文字が消えた。ウォール・ストリート・ジャーナル（WSJ）を含む多くのメディアは「イスラム国」（Islamic State）の名称を使っている。

CHINA

ISIS Video Shows

Threats by Uighurs

An Islamic State video appears to show recruits from China's Uighur minority threatening to "avenge oppression," feeding into Beijing's assertion of a growing jihadist-terror threat.

The half-hour video was released Monday by an Islamic State division in western Iraq, said the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online jihadist activity. Subtitled in both Arabic and Uighur, it shows what SITE says are Uighur fighters on the battlefield, as well as several grisly executions of accused informants.

Recruitment by Middle East jihadist groups has Beijing on increasingly high alert, particularly in its northwest Xinjiang region, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan and is home to the mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority. Leaked Islamic State records show that more than 100 Chinese nationals have joined the group in Syria, according to two recent studies, and Chinese officials say about 300 Uighurs are fighting with the jihadist movement in Syria and Iraq.

Victim Leaves Panel

On Protecting Minors

An Irish survivor of clergy sex abuse resigned from Pope Francis' commission for the protection of minors, strongly denouncing the Vatican for hindering the committee's work and bolstering critics who say the current pontificate has failed to adequately address the problem.

In announcing her resignation, Marie Collins, who suffered abuse from a priest as a child and has been a prominent campaigner for the Catholic Church to act more forcefully on the problem, accused the Vatican of leaving the committee under-resourced, failing to disseminate guidelines to bishops on dealing with cases and neglecting to respond to letters from victims.

Ms. Collins's resignation is the latest blow to the pope, who has been accused of failing to back up his strong words on the problem -- he has likened clerical abuse to a "black Mass" -- with concrete actions.

Pope Francis established the commission in 2014 to advise him on ways to prevent sex abuse by priests and church employees.

World News: Russia Courts Libyan General to Fight  ISIS  --- Growing embrace of enemy of government in Tripoli illustrates Moscow's Mideast push

MOSCOW -- The flagship of the Russian navy welcomed aboard a VIP as it cruised the Mediterranean in January: a Libyan general Moscow sees as the best chance to defeat Islamist extremists and re-establish order in the chaotic country.

The Kremlin's growing embrace of Gen. Khalifa Haftar, a rival of the United Nations-backed coalition government in Tripoli, signals Moscow's desire to extend its influence in the Middle East and North Africa after intervening in Syria's war. Now Russia is courting the Trump administration to get its support for the controversial general, people familiar with the Kremlin's thinking said.

Russia sees its role in the fight against Islamist terrorism as a selling point, and President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have touted the idea of Washington and Moscow cooperating to fight Islamic State.

Andrey Kortunov, director-general of the Russian International Affairs Council, which is close to the country's Foreign Ministry, said Russia had through diplomatic channels made the case to Washington for "potential cooperation on international terrorism because Libya might become one of the major hotbeds."

A person close to the Kremlin said Russian officials had spoken to officials at the U.S. National Security Council about Gen. Haftar, as well as efforts to combat Islamic State in Libya and Moscow's desire to make oil deals in the crude-rich country.

Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Kremlin hadn't reached out to the security council about Gen. Haftar. A White House National Security Council spokesman didn't respond to a request to comment.

Even though Mr. Trump has said he desired closer ties with Moscow, following the recent resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, he said the political mood in the U.S. made it difficult for him to pursue a rapprochement.

Russian air power and special forces have helped turn the tide in Syria in favor of the country's authoritarian president, Bashar al-Assad, and bolstered the Kremlin's ambitions as a regional power willing to use military force in fractured states.

In Libya, an adviser to Gen. Haftar's Libyan National Army, which controls much of the eastern part of the country, said Russia has sent midlevel military officers to help train its forces.

Ms. Zakharova said no Russian soldiers had been sent to aid Gen. Haftar.

Gen. Haftar and his spokesman couldn't be reached to comment. A spokesman for the Libyan National Army, which Gen. Haftar leads, didn't respond to questions about the general's contact with Russian officials and the presence of any Russian forces in Libya.

Gen. Haftar, seen by critics as a would-be autocrat in the mold of late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has traveled to Moscow twice in the past eight months and has requested weaponry, people close to the Kremlin said, despite a U.N . arms embargo.

Moscow says it maintains contact with all sides in Libya in the interest of finding a political solution to divisions in the country. Ms. Zakharova, the ministry spokeswoman, has described Gen. Haftar as "one of the political heavyweights who has real influence on the balance of political forces in modern Libya."

Before Gadhafi's demise, Libya was a longstanding ally of the Soviet Union and Russia.

A Defense Ministry spokesman declined to comment on any discussions of supplying arms to Libya.

Washington has largely kept its distance from Gen. Haftar, who was part of an effort to oust Gadhafi in the late 1980s. He went on to live in the U.S. for two decades. The general returned in 2011, as rebels fought to remove Gadhafi from power.

After Gadhafi was killed, Gen. Haftar pulled together a fighting force and went on the offensive against militant groups. His forces have scored some gains against Islamic State and regained control of some oil installations.

U.S.-backed forces have also made progress in the coastal city of Sirte and took over Islamic State's headquarters last year.

European countries have lobbied Russia to use its influence with Gen. Haftar, who has received support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, to get him to reconcile with the Tripoli government.

The leader of the U.N .-backed government, Faiez Serraj, was expected to arrive in Moscow in the coming days, Russian news agency Interfax quoted the deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, as saying on Monday.

 ISIS  Violence, Intimidation Escalate in Egypt's Sinai; Women who don't comply with the militants' dress code have been threatened with whipping, acid

In his meetings with Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, Mr. Sisi said counterterrorism and the protection of minorities were a priority for Cairo. An earlier version of the article incorrectly quoted Mr. Sisi as saying counterterrorism and the protection of minorities were a priority for Washington. (March 1, 2017)

ISMAILIA, Egypt—omen traveling on buses in northern Sinai say Islamic State fighters have boarded the vehicles, introduced themselves as religious police and threatened to whip them and splash them with acid if they don't comply with the militants' dress code.

"They lectured us on how to dress according to Islamic Shariah [law], and warned that those who don't wear full-face veils or travel without a male guardian will face punishment," said Marwa Elfar, a teacher who was traveling from Al Arish to Rafah, near Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip.

Such bus-boarding incidents by Islamic State militants, two of which occurred last week, coincide with a wave of attacks targeting Egypt's Coptic Christian families, spurring an exodus from the volatile northern area of the peninsula.

In the past week, at least 154 Christian families have fled their homes in Al Arish for Ismailia, the closest major city, according to church officials, marking the largest uprooting of Egyptians by violence in recent years.

The escalating violence and intimidation against both Muslims and Christians have again exposed the weakness of the Egyptian army in the region, despite pledges by President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi to restore security.

"Cairo's claimed strategy for countering jihadist violence in north includes protection of the local population, but here we see [Islamic State] fighters successfully targeting the region's most vulnerable population," said Zack Gold, an expert on Sinai at the Atlantic Council.

Such attacks by Egypt's Islamic State affiliate, known as Sinai Province, are designed to project power as the group loses ground in its Syrian and Iraqi strongholds, Mr. Gold added.

The radical group doesn't control any territory in northern Sinai but operates there with virtual impunity. Ms. Elfar said her bus was stopped by the masked men despite passing several Egyptian military checkpoints along the 25-mile journey from Al Arish to Rafah.

A spokesman for Egypt's military declined to comment Wednesday on the flight of Christians from the area and on Ms. Elfar's testimony, referring questions to the government.

Mr. Sisi, a former general, came to power in a 2013 military coup promising to eradicate extremism. His failure to quell the insurgency has led to criticism from Coptic Christians, who comprise some 10% of Egypt's population, and others targeted by Islamic State.

During separate meetings in Cairo last week with Egyptian security officials and Commander Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, Mr. Sisi said counterterrorism and the protection of minorities were a priority for Cairo.

But on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the Egyptian leader hadn't done enough to protect Christians in Sinai and elsewhere in Egypt.

While attacks by Islamic State and other militant groups mainly target security forces and soldiers in northern Sinai, insurgents have staged some of their deadliest attacks elsewhere in Egypt.

Sinai Province claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger jet over Sinai in October 2015 that killed all 224 people aboard. In December, it took responsibility for a suicide bombing at Cairo's main Coptic cathedral compound, which 29 Christians dead.

A Sinai Province video released last month identified the purported bomber in the cathedral attack and promised that more Egyptian Christians would be killed.

The video confirmed a string of sectarian killings by unidentified armed men in Al Arish, which left at least seven Christians dead, including last week's shooting of a Coptic man in front of his family.

Nagwa Fawzy, a Christian restaurant owner, fled Friday with 42 of her Christian relatives after her brother-in-law and nephew were shot and killed by unknown gunmen who then set their home ablaze. Her sister survived the attack, which Sinai Province is suspected of carrying out.

"I wouldn't have left. I have a business and a home there. Al Arish has been my home since 1969," Ms. Fawzy said. But after her family was killed, "staying was impossible."

She is now living in a youth hostel in Ismailia with little more than the clothes on her back, she said. Egypt's government has promised to cover housing and education costs for those who fled. But some say they fear a lack of security rather than money.

"Let's face it, soldiers and police forces in Al Arish, armed and licensed to kill, are scared," said one of Ms. Fawzy's nephews, Sameh, 35. "Why would we not be?"

Tuesday was a rough night for the resistance, and not just because Donald Trump gave the finest speech of his career. The movement also suffered grievous self-inflicted wounds in its continuing campaign to destroy the nation's 45th president. Democratic donors are no doubt beginning to ask themselves why they signed on for another era of Nancy Pelosi's leadership of their party in the House.

Mrs. Pelosi led Democratic women in wearing white, recalling the suffragette movement. This could have been a patriotic gesture of unity—imilar to the President's reference to Black History Month in the opening lines of his speech—llowing all Americans to appreciate how far human liberty has advanced in this great nation while recognizing challenges that remain. But instead it was a gimmick, used by Democrats to suggest that Mr. Trump is a threat to our most basic freedoms.

Mrs. Pelosi and her colleagues obviously decided before the event that they would provide television cameras with reaction shots expressing their disapproval or even contempt for the President. He caught them off guard by delivering a big-hearted, moving and gracious address, but they seemed unable to react in real time. The pantsuit caucus and their equally grumpy male Democratic colleagues continued to sit, frown and offer tepid applause or none at all even for lines that would be objectionable to no one outside of ISIS.

Perhaps the most compelling moment in the history of presidential addresses—ith the nation seeing a grieving widow as her heroic husband was being honored—lso was not sufficient to inspire the anti-Trumpers to alter their communications strategy. Then Democrats fled the chamber immediately at the conclusion of Mr. Trump's remarks like Jets fans in the third quarter. Even after it was over, Ms. Pelosi still didn't understand what had just happened and continued to fire off negative remarks across various media.

Tuesday was in many ways a mirror image of the start of the previous presidency. Whereas Mr. Obama gave Republicans not the slightest incentive to try to cooperate, Mr. Trump just made it extremely difficult for Democrats in swing districts to keep pretending he's Hitler.

One could argue that the Trump resistance is making encouraging progress in refining its message given that members of the movement began his presidency by fashioning headgear named after genitalia. But the campaign to de-legitimize Mr. Trump can't afford too many nights like Tuesday. And it will be interesting to watch which Democrats running in 2018 think they can afford to stand next to Mrs. Pelosi.

So much is written about our historically unpopular president that it's easy to overlook how unpopular the Democratic congressional leadership is. The latest WSJ/NBC poll shows that while Mr. Trump has only slightly higher negative ratings—7% compared to Mrs. Pelosi's 44%—e also has much higher positive ratings. In the survey, 46% of Americans have positive feelings toward Mr. Trump, while only 19% feel that way about the House Democratic leader.

This does not mean last night was an unmitigated triumph for conservatism. The President offered an encouraging promise of "big, big" tax cuts, but with few details. His calls for de-regulation were inspiring, such as when he pointed out the lives at stake when the FDA drags its feet on drug approvals. But after making a powerful case against government regulation of business, he then explained that government must regulate business that crosses our borders. This makes no sense, and as Mark Perry points out with a nearby chart, even if one believes the trade deficit in goods is a problem, one shouldn't forget the rising trade surplus we are running in services.

Still, after watching Tuesday's Trump triumph and the reaction of Democrats, Republicans running in 2018 probably have one thing on their minds this morning: Vive la Réistance!

SYRIA

Russia, China Veto

Sanctions Resolution

Russia and China vetoed a Western-backed U.N. resolution that would have imposed sanctions on 21 Syrian individuals, organizations and companies allegedly involved in chemical weapons attacks in the war-ravaged country.

The defeated Security Council resolution would also have banned all countries from supplying Syria's government with helicopters, which investigators have determined were used in chemical attacks.

In Tuesday's vote, the resolution got the minimum nine "yes" votes. In addition to China and Russia, Bolivia voted "no." Three countries abstained -- Egypt, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan.

The vetoed resolution followed a joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog that determined the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State extremist group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.

AUSTRALIA

Arrest Made in Alleged

Bid to Help ISIS

Australia arrested a man it says offered to help Islamic State develop a long-range guided missile and a detection system for incoming bombs.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Tuesday the man was arrested in the rural town of Young, northwest of the capital Canberra, after an 18-month investigation, and that the operation wasn't related to any planned attack in Australia.

The man is an Australian-born citizen, according to Andrew Colvin, commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. Identified in local press reports as Haisem Zahab, he appeared in court Tuesday where he was charged with two foreign-incursion offenses that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The man wasn't available for comment and it is unclear whether he has a lawyer.

Australia has stepped up security in recent years, giving police and intelligence agencies more power against homegrown militants. It has also sent troops and warplanes to combat Islamic State as part of the U.S.-led coalition, as well as supporting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The country's five-tier terrorism-threat system has been set at "probable," the third-highest level, since September 2014. That December, a gunman, later identified as Iranian immigrant Man Haron Monisj, took hostages in a Sydney cafe and held them for 16 hours before being killed by police. The cafe's manager and a female customer also died. Since then there have been four attacks and 12 others have been disrupted, most recently in December -- an Islamic State-inspired plot to set off bombs in central Melbourne. More than 50 people have been arrested on terrorism offenses.

Mr. Colvin said the man charged is an electrician who helped an overseas network of Islamic State contacts by researching and designing a laser device "to warn against incoming munitions used by coalition forces in Syrian and Iraq" and "researching, designing and modeling systems to assist (ISIS's) efforts to develop their own long-range missile capabilities."

While "technically trained," Mr. Colvin said, the man has no military background or previous weapon-design experience. He has also never traveled to Syria or Iraq, but made contact with Islamic State over the internet from his home.

He will reappear in a Sydney court next week.

JAPAN

Retail Sales Rise

For Third Month

Retail sales rose for a third straight month in January, a possible sign that long-stagnant private consumption may finally be regaining some strength.

Sales increased 1.0% from a year before, according to data released Tuesday by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. On month, retail sales increased 0.5%. Sales at large retailers fell 1.1% year over year, after adjustment for the change in the number of stores.

Household spending has been stagnant in the past few years as wage growth remained sluggish despite record corporate profits.

Japanese companies have been wary of offering permanent wage increases, citing tough competition overseas and uncertainties over the global outlook and, more recently, U.S. economic policy under President Donald Trump.

Current-Account

Deficit Narrows

Australia's current-account deficit narrowed sharply to a seasonally adjusted A$3.85 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the prior quarter, the Australia Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday.

Economists had expected a current-account deficit of A$4.0 billion in the quarter. The third-quarter deficit was A$10.2 billion.

Surging commodity prices have helped Australia to post record trade surpluses in recent months, amid expectations that prices of iron ore and coal will remain elevated for a while yet.

SYDNEY—ustralia has arrested a man it says offered to help Islamic State develop a long-range guided missile and a detection system for incoming bombs.

"Police will allege that the man arrested has sought to advise ISIL on how to develop high-tech weapons capability," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Tuesday. He said the man was arrested in the rural town of Young, northwest of the capital Canberra, after an 18-month investigation, and that the operation wasn't related to any planned attack in Australia.

The man—n Australian-born citizen, according to Andrew Colvin, commissioner of the Australian Federal Police—as identified in local press reports as Haisem Zahab.

Islamic State Drones Terrorize Iraqi Forces as Mosul Battle Rages; Militant group uses increasingly sophisticated drone technology to target troops, civilians

As they advance into Islamic State's remaining urban stronghold of west Mosul, Iraqi forces are struggling to counter the terror caused by the militant group's drones.

Iraqi forces have grown accustomed to enemy drones flying over the battlefield since Islamic State seized swaths of the country in 2014. They have used rifle fire and high-tech gadgets to counter them, and even have drones of their own.

But the militants have fine-tuned their drone technology. What were once improvised, remote-controlled aircraft resembling model planes are now commercially available quadcopters—rones with four helicopter-like blades—hat have been retrofitted to carry grenades that can be dropped over targets.

Islamic State's increased drone usage comes as army officials said Sunday they had retaken their first neighborhood west of the Tigris River, raising the Iraqi flag there. The battle for the west is the final step in the offensive to drive the militant group from Iraq's second-largest city.

The military last week seized the northern city's sprawling international airport, giving it a foothold in Mosul's densely packed western neighborhoods. Over the weekend, troops pushed deeper into those areas, led by special-forces units. The army also said it had seized control of Mosul's main power station.

Islamic State drones have regularly flown over west Mosul during the fight, sending troops running for cover.

Though the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq says Islamic State's increased drone capability won't have a major impact on the state of the battle for Mosul, it allows the group to target civilians and aid workers in east Mosul, giving Islamic State the ability to terrorize people no longer living under its rule and hampering the area's return to normal life.

"The drone issue is worrying," said Iraqi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool. "There is no technical way to [entirely] stop these drones."

While the strikes don't always hit their targets with precision, militants are perfecting their technique.

"There are so many videos and images of bombs being dropped with a surprising degree of accuracy that I believe there are skilled operators who can hit with a consistent degree of accuracy," said Nick Waters, an analyst at research firm Bellingcat, which focuses on open-source information, much of it from social media.

Islamic State typically loads its drones with conventional grenades that detonate on impact, dropping them by remote control as they hover over a target, according to a report this month from Bellingcat.

They often affix plastic tail fins to the grenade to increase its stability and accuracy, the report said. Some bombs employ munitions that Islamic State manufactures itself.

The bombs can be dropped with accuracy from a height of up to 1,000 feet, Bellingcat estimated. Such strikes have also been used by militants to create diversions during suicide attacks, it added.

To counter the drones, Iraq's army is using high-tech gadgets that can target them using radio waves. But devices available to the military are scarce. Troops are often forced to resort to shooting at the small, nearly noiseless drones with rifles.

At least one remote base near Mosul last fall, U.S. Army sentries manned their posts armed with machine guns and a device called DroneDefender manufactured by Ohio-based research-and-development outfit Battelle Memorial Institute. The U.S. military is supporting Iraqi forces from the air and ground in the fight against Islamic State.

DroneDefenders are rifle-shaped and feature thick antennas that when pointed at drones can scramble GPS or remote-control units up to a quarter of a mile away, causing the drones to fall.

A spokeswoman for Battelle said it had sold more than 100 units to the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.

"We have the DroneDefender and it works," said Lt. Col. Arkan Fadhil of the elite Iraqi special forces. He said few were available to Iraqi forces, without elaborating why.

Iraqi and American defense officials said Iraqi forces have such technology but declined to give further details, citing security concerns.

Exporting battlefield supplies from the U.S. to certain countries, like Iraq, requires special licenses.

Devices that emit radio frequencies can be subject to international regulations and red tape.

The Battelle spokeswoman said an export control license is required to ship products to foreign governments, but it doesn't have such a license to export to Iraq. She said the company has recently seen increased interest in the device around the world.

Last week, the U.S. Air Force announced a $15 million contract with ELTA North America Inc., a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries, for 21 counter-drone systems to be delivered in the next few months.

Further details weren't available. The Defense Department didn't respond to request for comment. An ELTA spokeswoman said the company doesn't discuss specific clients. But it recently touted a counter-drone system made expressly to down quadcopter-type machines.

At least one Popular Mobilization Unit, a militia allied with Iraq's army, says it has received counter-drone technology from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

Iran backs a number of Iraq's Shiite Muslim militias and recently developed numerous anti-drone technologies, including a drone-jamming antenna unveiled in December, according to semiofficial Iranian news agencies. Iranian officials haven't said whether these technologies are in use in Iraq.

"Either we get such tactical weapons directly from the Islamic Republic or we make them locally here, but in consultation with our brothers in revolutionary guards," said Jaffar al-Hussaini, spokesman of Hezbollah Battalions, a large militia operating west of Mosul.

Iraqi forces have also been using their own commercial drones for reconnaissance and to help identify Islamic State fighters posing as civilians.

On a recent day in west Mosul, Lt. Col. Fadhil was at an aid station near the front, his foot bandaged after being struck by a drone grenade.

"It's annoying, with someone always tossing a grenade on you," he said.

Meanwhile, in the east, citizens freed from Islamic State occupation now fear their drones. Near the ruins of Mosul University, Mohammed Yasin worked at a falafel stand.

"Every two to three days there's a drone attack," he said, and the army recently stationed a machine gun on the street to fire at the next one.

Aid groups have said drones make it nearly impossible to set up distribution stations as they are easily targeted.

Donald Trump Takes On Familiar Targets—ntelligence Agencies and the Press; President returns to tweeting and attacking despite GOP lawmakers' hopes for a reset

After a week that showed hints of the reset sought by Capitol Hill Republicans, President Donald Trump undertook several new attacks Friday focused on two of his frequent targets: the intelligence community and the press.

Mr. Trump began posting several tweets Friday morning pounding the intelligence community after reports that his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, asked officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation to refute a report on alleged contacts between Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and Russian intelligence officials.

Later in the morning, he delivered a freewheeling speech to conservative activists decrying the "fake news" media as the "enemy of the people." Several hours later, press secretary Sean Spicer took the unusual step of barring from a briefing several major news outlets that Mr. Trump has criticized in the past, and word began to circulate that a crackdown on leakers was in the works, according to a White House official.

In his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump cited priorities from immigration to trade, and said, "Basically, all I've done is keep my promises."

So far, Mr. Trump has signed 25 executive actions and memorandums. Six of them have established new rules. Nine directed agencies to review current rules and develop strategies to address the president's concerns—or example, a Jan. 28 memorandum ordering the secretary of defense to present a draft of "the plan to defeat ISIS" within 30 days.

Three orders directed agencies to strengthen the implementation of already existing laws, and another three ordered the development of a framework to roll back existing laws, such as regulations on the financial sector, at some point in the future. Two measures amounted to bits of bureaucracy reorganization.

On Friday, Mr. Trump signed his latest executive order, establishing a series of task forces to review existing regulations and recommend whether to repeal or simplify some of them. He said it would achieve "real results when it comes to removing job-killing regulations."

A White House official said Friday that some of Mr. Trump's orders made changes "on the front end," while others were "an initial step in a longer process to fix larger problems."

The White House has yet to present plans to overhaul the tax code or replace former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act through legislative action, though it has said it is working on both.

The debate over Mr. Trump's policies on health care this week prompted numerous shouting matches between Republican lawmakers and their constituents at town halls across the nation, while Congress was in recess.

New protests are likely to greet an expected revamp next week of an executive order that bans travelers from seven majority Muslim nations from entering the U.S. because of what the White House said are terrorism concerns. The last such order sparked protests in airports across the U.S. and was stayed by a federal court.

"Every day, it is going to be a fight," promised White House chief strategist Steve Bannon during an appearance at the conservative conference in Maryland on Thursday.

John Hudak, deputy director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said Mr. Trump's actions so far suggest "a president who is very interested in effecting public policy, but lacks an understanding of how to actually get the job done."

Mr. Obama, a Democrat, had issued more executive orders and memorandums than Mr. Trump in his first weeks in office. Within his first 30 days, Mr. Obama also signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus package, one of the largest economic rescue programs since President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and deployed 17,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.

An example of a troubled executive order is the one Mr. Trump signed on Jan. 25 seeking to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, which shield undocumented immigrants in defiance of the government.

The order initially appeared to be a major blow to those cities, which receive hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. But the order failed to define its terms, providing no description of what it deemed a sanctuary city or what types of federal funding it referred to. Three weeks later, the White House still hasn't identified the funds it can shut off.

There are also limits on White House control over the funds. Most federal dollars that go to cities are based on statutory grants that follow a formula and can only be stopped if the funds aren't being spent on the intended purpose. As a result, bond-market analysts said this week that the order is unlikely to hurt the municipalities' credit, at least in the short term.

Earlier this month, the administration made a splash on Wall Street announcing that it intended to scale back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, as part of a sweeping plan to dismantle much of the regulatory system put in place after the financial crisis.

But the orders Mr. Trump signed that day—urrounded by top Wall Street executives including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon—stablished a framework to do so, rather than actually repealing any regulations. One order directed regulators to identify costly rules and laws. Another paved the way for rolling back an Obama-era retirement savings rule that was set to take effect in April.

A presidential memorandum Mr. Trump signed on his third day in office ordering a freeze on the hiring of federal employees was intended to last 90 days, after which the director of the Office of Management and Budget was to recommend a "long-term plan" to reduce the size of the federal workforce.

Mr. Trump's OMB director wasn't confirmed until 25 days after he signed that memorandum—early a third of the time the president had allotted for crafting that plan.

The president isn't the first to launch his administration with a few promises that may ultimately be hard to keep.

In January 2009, Mr. Obama signed an executive order effectively directing his cabinet to examine how to shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within the year.

That mission proved more complicated than he anticipated and faced fierce opposition in Congress, and eight years later, the facility remains open.

Iraq Takes the Fight Against  ISIS  to Syria; Strikes on foreign territory mark major escalation in fight against Islamic State

Corrections & Amplifications

The Iraqi airstrikes targeted the villages of Husaiba and Abu Kamal in Syria. An earlier version of this article misspelled Abu Kamal as Albu Kamal. (Feb. 24, 2017)

MOSUL, Iraq—raq's air force on Friday carried out its first-ever strikes against Islamic State in neighboring Syria, the country's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said, marking a dramatic escalation in its effort to roll back the insurgency by pounding a sanctuary across the border.

The attack on foreign territory, even as Iraqi security forces at home slug it out with militants to retake western Mosul, shows how the Iraqi government is shifting its focus to an Islamic State that no longer has a major stronghold within the country.

"We are determined to chase terrorism, which tries to kill our sons and people, any place it exists," Mr. Abadi said.

Mr. Abadi ordered the strikes across the border after Iraqi military and intelligence officials traced recent Baghdad car bombings to planners in villages in Syria. The attacks followed coordination with the government in Damascus, according to Iraqi officials.

"This is the first time the Iraqi air force conducted airstrikes in Syrian lands," an Iraqi air force official said, adding that Iraqi F-16 jets made the strikes. "And for sure it was based on coordination with the Syrian side," he said.

Syria's information ministry didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the airstrikes, which targeted the villages of Husaiba and Abu Kamal just inside the Syrian border. U.S. defense officials didn't respond to a request for comment.

"The most significant aspect of that strike is that it demonstrates that ISIS' center of gravity has shifted from Mosul to the Syrian-Iraqi border area," said Nicholas Heras, a Middle East research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a security think tank in Washington, using another name for Islamic State. "It's the Iraqi government saying, ‘ook, we've got ISIS on the back leg, ISIS is going to fall.'"

The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is also likely eager to see Iraqis step up their campaign against Islamic State in the Syrian border regions because Mr. Assad's military can use those extra resources, Mr. Heras said.

"It is to Assad's benefit for Baghdad to take a much more proactive role in striking ISIS in that border area," Mr. Heras said, adding that it allows the Syrian president to be able to say he is working with other countries. That could help burnish his regime's image, which has been severely tarnished by a large number of reported human-rights abuses, including using chemical weapons against civilians. "It also allows Assad to say he's taking part in a coalition," he added.

Mr. Abadi's aggressive, new air tactics come as Iraqi ground forces push on the west side of Mosul to retake Iraq's second-largest city from the militants. After recently taking the east side of Mosul back from Islamic State—nd several Iraqi cities last year—raq's armed forces aim to deprive the extremist group any claim to a caliphate inside its country.

Iraq's security forces, preoccupied with fighting Islamic State, say their immediate mission is to eradicate the extremist group's remaining strongholds. "We do not care anymore if the threat is in Syria or anywhere else," said Brig. Gen. Tahseen al-Khafaji, a defense ministry spokesman. "Anything that threatens our security or future or our soil will be attacked."

On Friday, defense officials declared the Mosul airport and an adjacent military compound completely under Iraqi government control as forces pushed north to the old, dense neighborhoods of the city where combat is expected to become increasingly difficult.

As Islamic State loses territory in Iraq, it has picked up the pace of terror attacks elsewhere in the country. Residents of Baghdad endure the constant threat of suicide bombs and recently the capital has seen days where dozens die and are wounded by several bombs. Last week, a series of bombings in the capital left more than 100 dead or injured in one day, with one car bomb killing more than 50. Last year, a truck bomb killed some 300 people at a shopping complex during Ramadan.

That security situation has given Mr. Abadi's critics, including the anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, reason to stage mass demonstrations in the capital demanding tougher measures from Mr. Abadi.

Mr. Sadr poses a significant and unpredictable challenge to the government. Last year, he marshaled supporters to protest government corruption and his followers stormed the Green Zone, a fortified government and diplomatic enclave, and they occupied Parliament for a short period. Earlier this month, another mass protest ended in a handful of deaths of police and his supporters.

Meanwhile, the threat of Islamic State endures, especially in the desert land straddling the Syrian-Iraq border, where militants have applied pressure for years and where Islamic State came of age before sweeping into Mosul in 2014.

Extinguishing those threats will be a challenge for Iraq's taxed security forces, who are now waging a war in a sectarian tinderbox. Mosul has become a central hub around which armed forces from a variety of backgrounds vie for power: Kurd, Sunni Arab, Shiite Arab, Christian and others.

Sunni-majority areas such as Ramadi, Fallujah and even Mosul are chafing under the Shiite-led central government. Many residents of those places say such grumblings had similar potency two years ago, allowing Islamic State to sweep in with either support from or indifference of locals. Now, new resentments are dampening excitement of being freed from Islamic State's domination.

"No money at all has been allocated to the municipality," said Abdul Sattar al-Habbu, head of Mosul's public works who said water pipes and electric distribution had been ruined, and garbage collection disrupted. "If things keep like this, we will see another Daesh," he said, using another name for Islamic State.

The defeat of Islamic State and a renewed effort to protect the homeland, could play well for Mr. Abadi, whose political fortunes have waned recently and who is navigating a shifting balance of power in the Middle East as Russia asserts itself, Iran attempts to project influence and U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to upend a number of existing relationships.

"There is one important issue to keep in mind," the defense ministry's Gen. Khafaji said. "There is an Iraqi, Syrian, Russian and Iranian coalition. This coalition is working now and part of its duty is to face terrorism. So these four countries share information just to eliminate terrorism."

A U.S.-led coalition helps Iraqi troops with precision airstrikes and military advisers on the ground, and under President Trump, have begun to work with Iraqi counterparts closer to the front lines than under operational rules laid out during former President Barack Obama's time in office.

After a week that showed hints of the reset sought by Capitol Hill Republicans, President Donald Trump undertook several new attacks Friday focused on two of his frequent targets: the intelligence community and the press.

Mr. Trump began posting several tweets Friday morning pounding the intelligence community after reports that his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, asked officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation to refute a report on alleged contacts between Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and Russian intelligence officials.

Later in the morning, he delivered a freewheeling speech to conservative activists decrying the "fake news" media as the "enemy of the people." Several hours later, press secretary Sean Spicer took the unusual step of barring from a briefing several major news outlets that Mr. Trump has criticized in the past, and word began to circulate that a crackdown on leakers was in the works, according to a White House official.

In his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump cited priorities from immigration to trade, and said, "Basically, all I've done is keep my promises."

So far, Mr. Trump has signed 25 executive actions and memorandums. Six have established new rules. Nine directed agencies to review current rules and develop strategies to address the president's concerns -- for example, a Jan. 28 memorandum ordering the secretary of defense to present a draft of "the plan to defeat ISIS" within 30 days.

Three orders directed agencies to strengthen the implementation of already existing laws, and another three ordered the development of a framework to roll back existing laws, such as regulations on the financial sector, at some point in the future. Two measures amounted to bits of bureaucracy reorganization.

On Friday, Mr. Trump signed his latest executive order, establishing a series of task forces to review existing regulations and recommend whether to repeal or simplify some of them. He said it would achieve "real results when it comes to removing job-killing regulations."

A White House official said some of Mr. Trump's orders made changes "on the front end," while others were "an initial step in a longer process to fix larger problems."

The White House has yet to present plans to overhaul the tax code or replace former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act through legislative action, though it has said it is working on both.

The debate over Mr. Trump's policies on health care this week prompted numerous shouting matches between Republican lawmakers and their constituents at town halls across the nation, while Congress was in recess.

New protests are likely to greet an expected revamp next week of an executive order that bans travelers from seven majority Muslim nations from entering the U.S. because of what the White House said are terrorism concerns. The last such order sparked protests in airports across the U.S. and was stayed by a federal court.

"Every day, it is going to be a fight," promised White House chief strategist Steve Bannon during an appearance at the conservative conference in Maryland on Thursday.

John Hudak, deputy director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said Mr. Trump's actions so far suggest "a president who is very interested in effecting public policy, but lacks an understanding of how to actually get the job done."

Mr. Obama, a Democrat, had issued more executive orders and memorandums than Mr. Trump in his first weeks in office. Within his first 30 days, Mr. Obama also signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus package, one of the largest economic rescue programs since President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and deployed 17,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.

An example of a troubled executive order is the one Mr. Trump signed on Jan. 25 seeking to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, which shield undocumented immigrants in defiance of the government.

The order initially appeared to be a major blow to those cities, which receive hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. But the order failed to define its terms, providing no description of what it deemed a sanctuary city or what types of federal funding it referred to. Three weeks later, the White House still hasn't identified the funds it can shut off.

There are also limits on White House control over the funds. Most federal dollars that go to cities are based on statutory grants that follow a formula and can only be stopped if the funds aren't being spent on the intended purpose. As a result, bond-market analysts said this week that the order is unlikely to hurt the municipalities' credit, at least in the short term.

Trump to Add Some Muscle to U.S. Strategy to Fight Islamic State; President to consider options that are expected to include sending more troops to Syria and Iraq, according to U.S. officials

WASHINGTON—resident Donald Trump's new strategy to accelerate the fight against Islamic State will, at least initially, tweak and add a little more muscle to the existing plan, U.S. officials said.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected to provide to Mr. Trump a series of recommendations for that plan in the coming days. Mr. Trump on Jan. 28 signed an order directing his new Pentagon chief to come up with a preliminary draft of the plan to fight Islamic State within 30 days.

The president will consider a range of options that are expected to include sending additional troops to Syria and Iraq, at least in limited numbers, according to U.S. officials.

Two other possible steps could involve loosening battlefield restrictions, the officials said. One such step would give commanders more decision-making power on the use of U.S. forces in the field. A second would ease rules designed to minimize civilian casualties, according to U.S. officials. Loosening the civilian casualty rules would have the effect of increasing the number and rate of operations against Islamic State, officials said.

"What we're trying to do …s to outline the options that exist for dealing with the ISIS threat …ut also to clearly outline for him the consequences, the opportunity costs, the risks associated with each one of the options that we present," said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joe Dunford, at a think-tank event in Washington. Gen. Dunford declined to answer questions about the changes.

There's little indication that Mr. Trump's ultimate decision will fundamentally shake up the existing approach, said U.S. officials and analysts, which relies heavily on indigenous forces taking on the fight against Islamic State with limited numbers of American advisers following closely behind.

American and foreign diplomats have pointed to the Trump administration's decision to keep Obama administration holdover Brett McGurk on as the State Department's coordinator for the U.S. coalition against Islamic State as a sign that the U.S. approach to the conflict is unlike to change dramatically in the short term.

"There will be some difference in terms of rules of engagement, the number of advise-and-assist and [special operations forces] elements involved, but I don't think it's going to be dramatically different," said Kathleen Hicks, director of the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "The plan as it's being executed right now is proving to be quite successful. They will take the best of that and build out areas that they think need to be beefed up."

Some adjustments in the U.S. approach already have been made within the past month, Gen. Dunford said. And last fall, battlefield commanders were given more latitude in making their own decisions about conducting airstrikes, and American troops in Iraq now are operating in closer proximity to their Iraqi counterparts.

Mr. Trump also is expected to decide whether to directly arm the Kurdish force known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, a move thought to be key to the elimination of Islamic State by breaking its grip on its de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria.

A decision by Mr. Trump to directly arm the YPG would anger Turkey, which classifies the group an extension of Kurdish separatists classified in Turkey as a terrorist group.

"What we don't want to do is bring [the president] options that solve one problem, only to create a second problem," Gen. Dunford said at the Brookings Institution on Thursday.

Many U.S. officials want to move quickly on Raqqa to prevent Islamic State leaders from escaping and setting up operations elsewhere to continue planning attacks on Western targets.

Turkey has offered to help with the fight for Raqqa, but only if the Kurds aren't part of the ground force, U.S. officials said. Kurdish fighters are willing to take part in the fight for Raqqa, but only if Turkey is excluded, the officials said.

Mr. Trump is aggressively exploring the option of creating informal safe zones in Syria, an idea that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pushed for years. The Pentagon has long opposed the idea of creating official Syrian safe zones due to costs and necessary military commitments.

But there is growing receptiveness to the idea of setting up unofficial Syrian safe zones—hich some officials have dubbed "interim de-escalation areas"—long the Turkey and Jordan borders.

The zones wouldn't have to be new areas taken over by the U.S. military, as officials have explained them. One area in question in northern Syria along the Turkish border is now controlled by the Turkish military and the Syrian rebel groups backed by Ankara.

The Turkish military, backed by U.S. special operations forces and American airstrikes, entered Syria last August and Turkey and its allies and have seized more than 650 square miles of territory. Mr. Erdogan has vowed to create a 2,000-square-mile safe zone that would include housing for Syrian refugees.

Some U.S. officials see the area Turkey has created as a good place to expand a safe zone should the U.S. back such a policy, discussions that remain in the early stages, U.S. officials said.

If Mr. Trump expands the American presence in Iraq, Syria and beyond, it's likely that allies would be willing to contribute more.

France is willing to increase its military effort in Syria, for example, should the U.S. decide to step up its efforts there, according to a Western diplomat.

French officials told the U.S. last week in Europe that they'd like to see efforts in Raqqa be sped up, even if they don't want to see a radical change in strategy for the campaign in Syria, a diplomat said. No final decision on sending additional troops has been made by Paris as French officials await Mr. Trump's decisions.

Rebels Claim Capture of Syrian City From  ISIS ; Turkish-backed group takes al-Bab as peace talks with regime open in Geneva

Turkish-backed rebels said they had seized one of Islamic State's last urban strongholds in northern Syria on Thursday, as the opposition began a new round of peace talks with the regime in Geneva.

Turkey said forces had entered the center of al-Bab. The capture of the city would further shrink the extremist group's territory, which still includes its de facto capital in Syria, Raqqa, as well as large parts of the surrounding province and the neighboring province of Deir Ezzour. In the Iraqi city of Mosul, U.S.-backed government forces dealt Islamic State another loss on Thursday by taking part of the international airport.

"We rid the whole city from ISIS this morning and now we are headed toward Tadif," said Mutasim Abbas, a commander with the rebel Mutasim Brigade, part of a coalition of opposition groups in the battle for al-Bab. Tadif, on the southern outskirts of al-Bab, sits on the highway leading to Raqqa and could mean the Turkish-backed forces intend to eventually launch an offensive on the city.

Turkey has played a central role in the fight for al-Bab, and has launched airstrikes on targets in the city.

"Today we can say that almost all of al-Bab has been taken under control, and that [forces have] entered the center of town," Turkish defense minister, Fikri Isik, told Turkish television. "We will say that al-Bab is completely cleared of Daesh elements when search and screening activities are finished," he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

The peace talks, backed by the United Nations, opened as escalating regime airstrikes and clashes between the two sides showed the fragility of a two-month-old cease-fire. Talks in Kazakhstan in January and February were meant to secure the cease-fire, but failed to put in place a monitoring mechanism to ensure it wasn't violated.

U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said Wednesday that Russia, a key regime backer, had asked Damascus to halt airstrikes on rebel-held areas during the course of the talks, which are expected to continue into next week.

"I'm not expecting a breakthrough…ut a beginning of a series of rounds that should enable to go much more in depth on the substantive issues that are required for a political solution in Syria," Mr. de Mistura said.

Islamic State is excluded from the Geneva talks and has been steadily losing territory across Syria and Iraq as many forces—ome also at war with one another—ave battled against the militants.

Which force will lead the battle to take Raqqa has been the subject of much diplomatic debate.

Turkey, an important U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State, has been pushing to sideline the Kurdish-led SDF, a U.S.-backed force fighting the terror group elsewhere in Syria, in favor of one dominated by Arab rebel fighters. Raqqa is a predominantly Arab city.

But U.S. officials have long maintained that it would be difficult to launch a successful assault on Raqqa without the Kurdish YPG militia that leads the SDF.

The offensive against al-Bab began months ago as Turkish-backed rebels gradually took control over much of the surrounding countryside. Turkey credited U.S. warplanes with helping to launch airstrikes on militant targets ahead of ground assaults.

At the same time, forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were also advancing near the city, raising the specter of clashes between the two sides which are in open warfare elsewhere in Syria.

The two-week offensive inside the city was slowed as a result of the entrenched Islamic State militants who dug trenches, planted mines and sent suicide car bombers, said Mahmoud Hamo, a spokesman with Faylaq al-Sham, a U.S.-backed rebel faction under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army. In addition, thousands of civilians weren't able to flee their homes and hunkered down amid the fighting and daily airstrikes.

More than 120 civilians, including 38 children, were killed since Feb. 7 as a result of Turkish airstrikes and artillery, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Islamic State's media agency, Amaq, reported that more than 380 civilians were killed as a result of the airstrikes and offensive.

On Thursday, rebel forces supported by the Turkish military were already clearing mines and other explosives laid by Islamic State throughout al-Bab, reported Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency.

Planting explosives before withdrawing from towns and cities is a common tactic by Islamic State and has led to the deaths of at least dozens of civilians in Syria, monitoring groups reported.

Some residents of al-Bab who had stayed throughout the two-week offensive were leaving their homes on Thursday as engineering units were beginning to comb the city looking for improvised explosive devices, including inside homes and public buildings, said Mohammad Al-Sheikh, a native of al-Bab and member of the First Regiment rebel faction.

"The homes are heavily planted with improvised explosive devices so they will leave until we clear and dismantle them," he said. "There is no life in the city, no electricity, no water, no infrastructure."

World News: Senator Secretly Visits War Zone

WASHINGTON -- Sen. John McCain secretly traveled to northern Syria last weekend to speak with American military officials and Kurdish fighters at the forefront of the push to drive Islamic State out of their de facto capital of Raqqa, according to U.S. officials.

The unusual visit, which officials said was organized with the help of the U.S. military, came as the Trump administration is debating plans for an accelerated military campaign against Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL.

Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, first traveled to rebel-controlled Syria in 2013, when he met with leaders of the Free Syrian Army, the umbrella group supported by America and its allies. This was believed to be his first visit to Syria since then.

U.S. officials familiar with Mr. McCain's trip said that the senator traveled to Kobani, the Syrian town on the Turkey border controlled by Kurdish forces since 2012.

In a statement, Mr. McCain's office confirmed that a trip took place, saying the senator "traveled to northern Syria last week to visit U.S. forces deployed there and to discuss the counter-ISIL campaign and ongoing operations to retake Raqqa."

Mr. McCain is believed to be the first U.S. lawmaker to travel to the Kurdish-controlled area of northeastern Syria since it became a hub for American special-operations forces who are aiding local forces in the fight against Islamic State.

The short visit came in the middle of a regional trip that took Mr. McCain from Saudi Arabia to Turkey, where he discussed evolving plans to counter Islamic State in the Middle East.

After traveling to Syria, Mr. McCain met with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital. Mr. Erdogan is pushing the Trump administration to sideline the Kurdish fighters that U.S. military leaders view as a vital ally in the fight against Islamic State.

Last month, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii), secretly traveled to Damascus, where she held a meeting with President Bashar al-Assad. Last year, Brett McGurk, America's special envoy for the international coalition to defeat ISIS, traveled to Kobani and met with Kurdish fighters, creating an uproar in Turkey.

Kushner, Ivanka Trump Pushed to Remove Words Critical of Climate Deal From Executive Order; President plans to issue orders aimed at rolling back Obama climate agenda soon

WASHINGTON—t the request of President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, language critical of a global climate deal was struck from an executive order that Mr. Trump is planning to sign soon, according to multiple people familiar with the move.

Mr. Trump is expected to sign within days at least two executive orders that will begin the process of trying to dismantle former President Barack Obama's climate and environmental regulations.

Mr. Kushner, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, and Ms. Trump, the president's eldest daughter, intervened to strike language about the climate deal from an earlier draft of the executive order, according to these people.

The executive order, which targets Mr. Obama's broad climate agenda, now includes no mention of the climate deal, which nearly 200 nations struck in Paris in 2015, in large part due to a strong push by the Mr. Obama's administration.

One White House official said both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have been considered a moderating influence on the White House's position on climate change and environmental issues. The move is the latest sign of influence Mr. Trump's daughter and Mr. Kushner have in a White House that has seen internal divisions on a variety of issues, including foreign policy.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to cancel the climate deal and said it hurt U.S. companies. He has said once since the election that he would be open to remaining a part of the accord, though his top advisers have since maintained that Mr. Trump doesn't take seriously the issue of climate change.

Ms. Trump, in particular, has said that she wants to focus on addressing climate change during her father's administration, a goal that led to a meeting in December between Mr. Trump and former Vice President Al Gore, an influential climate activist. After the meeting, Mr. Gore described the meeting with Mr. Trump as a "sincere search for areas of common ground."

The U.S. commitment to the Paris deal falls under the State Department's jurisdiction. White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Thursday declined to comment on whether Mr. Trump plans to follow through on his campaign promise to withdraw from the deal, saying instead that is a conversation Mr. Trump is having with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

"I think I will leave that to Secretary Tillerson," Mr. Spicer said.

As CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., Mr. Tillerson backed the Paris deal, and he broadly reiterated his support in his confirmation hearing, saying he thinks the U.S. is better served by staying in the accord rather than withdrawing. He emphasized, though, that any final decision would be made by Mr. Trump.

A request for comment to the State Department wasn't immediately returned.

The executive order targeting Mr. Obama's climate agenda, framed in terms of promoting energy independence and domestic energy development, is expected to call for the repeal of Obama administration rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants. The order is also expected to target Obama-era rules on emissions of methane from oil and natural gas wells on federal lands, and to seek to reverse a temporary ban on coal leasing.

The repeal process will take years and is certain to face lawsuits by states and environmental groups.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump mocked climate change and dismissed it as a serious issue that needs a solution. His top aides, including chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon, have struck similar tones.

Most scientists say that human activity contributes to climate change. Almost every country participates in an annual United Nations conference to address the issue, which produced the Paris climate deal.

The U.S. commitment to that agreement relies mostly on the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon rule, which the Trump administration is expected to seek to roll back. It calls for a 32% cut in power-plant carbon emissions by 2030 based on 2005 emission levels.

"I think Paris is still being discussed, and I think there is pushing from our direction and from the pro-Paris direction," said Myron Ebell, who focuses on energy and the environment at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute and was a member of Mr. Trump's transition team on EPA issues. Mr. Ebell, who doesn't agree with the scientific consensus on climate, told reporters in London earlier this year that Mr. Trump would withdraw from the deal.

Mr. Ebell said that repealing the carbon role while remaining in the deal itself would make little sense.

"How can you remain a member of the Paris treaty if your commitment isn't even close to reaching it?" Mr. Ebell said.

The agreement aims to keep average global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels through individualized national limits on greenhouse gas emissions, though the deal doesn't itself achieve that level of emissions cuts. World leaders hope to make more aggressive cuts in the years to come through the national plans to curb greenhouse-gas emissions.

The deal doesn't legally require countries to curb emissions or take other steps on climate change—n the U.S. that would have likely required ratification by the Senate, which Mr. Obama was unlikely to get—ut it does require countries to release their targets and report emissions.

The other directive Mr. Trump is planning to sign soon calls on the EPA to begin the process of repealing a rule bringing more bodies of water under federal jurisdiction, which has long faced opposition from lawmakers representing largely rural states, as well as a host of business and agricultural interest groups.

Both the water rule and EPA's rule cutting carbon emissions from power plants have faced legal rebukes. The Supreme Court took the unusual step in February 2016 of temporarily blocking the carbon rule until all litigation was complete, and a federal court similarly blocked nationwide the water rule in October 2015 until litigation plays out.

Iraqi Forces Close to Controlling Mosul Airport; Push marks major step in fight to retake city's western side from Islamic State

MOSUL, Iraq—raqi military forces were nearly in control of Mosul's international airport on Thursday, Iraqi military officials said, a major step in their fight to retake the Islamic State-held western side of the city.

By sunset, troops came under occasional mortar fire by the extremists and prepared for the next day's push on dense Islamic State-controlled neighborhoods just beyond the airport. Iraqi commandos also attacked a former government military base next to the airport complex, sweeping through farmland along the Tigris river, the officials said.

"Now the battle for the west side has started," said Brig. Yahya Rasool, spokesman for Iraq's joint operations command, after meeting with other top officials near the front.

The highly symbolic victory gives Iraqi forces a foothold in the center of western Mosul, on the outskirts of which they have battled for days to push back Islamic State.

The extremist group seized Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, in June 2014. It was there that its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria.

The government offensive to remove the extremists from their last major urban stronghold in Iraq began in October in the city's east.

U.S.-backed Iraqi forces suffered heavy casualties as they recaptured eastern Mosul, declaring it fully retaken last month.

Following a weekslong pause to regroup, they announced Sunday the start of ground operations to reclaim areas of western Mosul. Troops quickly retook the strategic outlying village of Albu Saif, which sits on high ground next to the airport.

On Thursday, "we broke the enemy's defense lines," said Col. Falah al-Webdan, a commander with the elite Emergency Response Division, which is at the front.

"The real fighting will start tomorrow," he added, referring to his troops' mission to start assaulting the first dense neighborhoods inside the western half of the city.

At a U.S.-supported aid station near the front, U.S. and Western allied medics treated a line of Iraqi troops suffering shrapnel and explosion wounds.

The fight for western Mosul is expected to involve house-to-house fighting in dense older neighborhoods and the use of some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who remain there as human shields by Islamic State fighters.

"We can't use tanks or heavy artillery because of civilians," Brig. Rasool said.

Civilians in the west are already feeling the effects of the approaching fight.

Volunteer medics manning front-line aid stations said some 40 civilians were treated Thursday for wounds from shrapnel and explosions, and that five had died either on the way to the clinic or while being treated. One corpse was brought in on the back of a donkey, medics said.

Iraqi troops organized buses for women and children from western Mosul to be transported to camps for displaced people. Civilian men were loaded onto the back of military flatbeds to be screened to make sure they weren't extremists.

Fathay Ahmed squatted by the side of the crowded bus as her young son vomited in the dirt with an unknown ailment. She said her other son, who had a mental illness, had been killed hours earlier.

"He just ran toward Iraqi troops," the 45-year-old said. "An [improvised explosive device] went off and killed him."

German Police Arrest Man With Bomb-Making Material; The move follows the detention of two other suspected Islamic terrorists this month

BERLIN—erman police detained a 26-year-old German man suspected of planning a terror attack and seized bomb-making material at his home, prosecutors and local police said on Thursday.

Authorities in the state of Lower Saxony said the man, whose name wasn't released, confessed to planning a bomb attack on soldiers or policemen. He is a follower of the fundamentalist Salafi branch of Islam that security officials say has become a breeding ground for terrorists.

The arrest comes only two weeks after police in the same region arrested two other men suspected of plotting at attack. Authorities across the country have been on heightened alert since an attack on a Berlin Christmas market in December that left 12 dead and was later claimed by the terror group Islamic State.

Germany's domestic intelligence agency Wednesday warned that the country was witnessing a rapid rise in the number of radical Islamists and had been receiving an unprecedented number of tips about impending terror attacks. The number of known Islamic extremists in the country had risen to around 1,600 from some 100 in 2013, said Hans-Georg Maassen, Germany's domestic intelligence chief. Of those, police considers some 570 to be capable of committing an attack.

"Fighting all manifestations of terrorism and Islamism has top priority," said Uwe Lürig, president of the police in Götingen, which conducted the recent arrests,

Prosecutors and police said the man detained on Wednesday confessed that he planned to lure police officials or soldiers into a trap and then kill them with a self-made explosive device.

During the raid in the small town of Northeim, police found chemicals and other materials that can be used to manufacture an unconventional explosive device, police and prosecutors said.

Police in Götingen earlier this month arrested an Algerian and a Nigerian man suspected of plotting an attack. A police spokeswoman said for now there was no indication of any connection between the two plots.

Police had found weapons, ammunition, a machete and ISIS flags in their homes and recovered electronic communications in which the two talked about an attack "similar to that in Berlin" in December.

On Dec. 19, rejected Tunisian asylum-seeker Anis Amri killed 12 people and injured scores by ramming with a truck at a busy Christmas market in the German capital. The attack spurred a flurry of government initiatives to beef up the surveillance of suspected extremists in the country and expedite the deportation of the foreigners among them.

Investigations into both suspected plots are ongoing, a police spokeswoman said. The state of Lower Saxony is currently trying to deport the Algerian and Nigerian suspects, who were born in Germany but don't have German nationality.

John McCain Makes Secret Trip to Syria in Midst of U.S. Assessment; The senator traveled to Kurdish-controlled Kobani, U.S. officials say

WASHINGTON—en. John McCain (R-Ariz.) secretly traveled to northern Syria last weekend to speak with American military officials and Kurdish fighters at the forefront of the push to drive Islamic State out of their de facto capital of Raqqa, according to U.S. officials.

The unusual visit, which officials said was organized with the help of the U.S. military, came as the Trump administration is debating plans for an accelerated military campaign against Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL.

Mr. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,

first traveled to rebel-controlled Syria in 2013, when he met with leaders of the Free Syrian Army, the umbrella group supported by America and its allies. This was believed to be his first visit to Syria since then.

U.S. officials familiar with Mr. McCain's trip said that the senator traveled to Kobani, the Syrian town on the Turkey border controlled by Kurdish forces since 2012.

In a statement, Mr. McCain's office confirmed that a trip took place, saying the senator "traveled to northern Syria last week to visit U.S. forces deployed there and to discuss the counter-ISIL campaign and ongoing operations to retake Raqqa."

Mr. McCain is believed to be the first U.S. lawmaker to travel to the Kurdish-controlled area of northeastern Syria since it became a hub for American special-operations forces who are aiding local forces in the fight against Islamic State.

The short visit came in the middle of a regional trip that took Mr. McCain from Saudi Arabia to Turkey, where he discussed evolving plans to counter Islamic State in the Middle East.

After traveling to Syria, Mr. McCain met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Turkish capital. Mr. Erdogan is pushing the Trump administration to sideline the Kurdish fighters that U.S. military leaders view as a vital ally in the fight against Islamic State.

It is rare for U.S. politicians to travel to Syria. Last month, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), secretly traveled to Damascus, where she held a controversial meeting with President Bashar al-Assad. Last year, Brett McGurk, America's special envoy for the international coalition to defeat ISIS, traveled to Kobani and met with Kurdish fighters, creating an uproar in Turkey.

Ankara views the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria as terrorists aligned with Kurdish separatists in Turkey embroiled in a yearslong battle for more autonomy. Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish leaders criticized Mr. McGurk after he was photographed receiving a plaque from a leader of the Syrian Kurdish force.

Mr. McGurk, who was asked by the Trump administration to stay on in his job, is in the thick of a debate over when and how to launch an assault on Raqqa.

President Donald Trump has asked the U.S. military to present him with a new plan to destroy Islamic State, and the report is supposed to be finished by the end of the month.

Central to the debate is whether or not to rely on Kurdish forces to take Raqqa, a city with a Sunni majority that is likely to be wary of Kurdish control.

U.S. officials involved in the debate say that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to launch a successful assault on Raqqa in the coming months without working with Kurdish forces. Turkish leaders have been pushing the Trump administration to sideline the Kurdish fighters, but they have not presented a viable alternative plan, U.S. officials said.

Iraq Is a Huge Opportunity for Trump; Abandoned in 2011, the country had made a remarkable comeback. The U.S. can help it succeed.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis's visit to Iraq on Monday made headlines largely because he reassured the Iraqi people that the U.S. is "not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil." Meanwhile, as the battle for Mosul continues, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq acknowledged that, while U.S. forces remain in an advise-and-assist role, "we are operating closer and deeper into the Iraqi formation."

Perhaps because of Iraq's inclusion in President Trump's ill-fated immigration order, many Iraqis tend to see him positively, as a strong leader committed to defeating Islamic State. While the Jan. 29 Yemen raid, in which a Navy SEAL was killed, was costly, it showed Mr. Trump is willing to take risks to defeat ISIS in the region. At the same time, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is stepping forward as a figure of real stature: a popular politician, reformer and successful war leader.

Mr. Trump and his advisers must not underestimate Iraq's importance. The Sunni-Shiite problem, on whose fault-line Iraq sits, is among the most critical U.S. geopolitical challenges since the Cold War. When President Obama took office in 2009, Iraq was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. It was a dedicated U.S. ally at peace with its neighbors, a land of 32 million people under a popular federalist constitution passed by a legitimate parliament. Election after election, Iraqis defied risks to vote in turnouts of 70% or more. Across religious divides more moderate parties consistently dominated.

Mr. Obama's abandonment of Iraq in 2011 was both military and diplomatic. The first imperative for the Trump administration is to understand what really happened. Staffing at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad—nce the largest in the world—as halved. U.S. offices around the country were closed. No senior U.S. person with a profile above the technocratic level has been tasked with Iraq since the estimable Ambassador Ryan Crocker left in 2009. Iraqis value being taken seriously, and downgrading them has been far from diplomatic.

My own business in Iraq has provided a worm's-eye view. We spent almost two years working closely with the Overseas Private Investment Corp.—ncle Sam's international lending operation, established to further U.S. foreign-policy goals—o set up a heavy-equipment rental firm in Iraq's southern oil fields. The Obama administration killed the project due to the diplomatic deprioritization of Iraq.

A far more important cost of America's diplomatic retreat was the survival for far too long of the premiership of Nouri al-Maliki. His Shiite chauvinism paved the way for the defeated Baathist-Wahhabi insurgency to reinvent itself as Islamic State. Mr. Maliki's corruption and despotic tendencies badly weakened the ability of Iraq's army, state and economy to resist the insurgent threat.

Today the U.S. armed presence in Iraq approaches 10,000. Had we left this many troops in country after 2011, they would still be in their air-conditioned bases, quietly guaranteeing the peace as their colleagues do in Korea and Germany, and nobody would have heard of Islamic State.

Instead ISIS rose to cause terrible harm in Iraq and doom Syria's secular revolution. Now American soldiers are back in Iraq and are fighting in Syria too. Priceless elements of mankind's cultural heritage have been erased, millions have been killed and displaced, thousands of children and young women remain in sexual slavery, and Russia has a naval base in the Mediterranean.

Yet now Iraq bounces back again, giving Mr. Trump's team much to work with. The Baghdad stock market is among the best-performing on earth over the past six months, up 48% in U.S. dollar terms. Business in the southern oil fields is surging toward pre-ISIS levels.

Under the worst imaginable provocations—addam Hussein, U.S.-led invasion, Sunni insurgency, Iranian death squads, Mr. Maliki's sectarian misrule, the rise of Islamic State—raqi society never descended into widespread violence. Belatedly cajoling the Iraqi political class to dump Mr. Maliki was a rare success for the Obama administration. Mr. Abadi's leadership is an expression of Iraq's fundamental pragmatism and tolerance.

Rolling back Islamic State, firing corrupt officials left over from the Maliki era, keeping at bay predatory neighbors like Iran and Turkey, surviving a halving of oil prices at the worst possible time—he soft-spoken Mr. Abadi is developing into an impressive figure.

So how can the Trump administration help Mr. Abadi succeed? The U.S. is already removing the absurd Obama-era restraints upon our forces fighting Islamic State. This should continue, but we need to do a better job supplying the Iraqi military. An arbitrary cap on "boots on the ground" means there are not enough U.S. forces to back up Iraqis in air transport, logistics, emergency medicine and intelligence—ll areas where the Iraqis need help.

Iraqis have long relied on the U.S. for their marquee military systems, including the M1A1 Abrams tank, the F-16 fighter and the C-130 transport. But in 2012, when the Obama administration rejected an Iraqi plan to adopt the Apache helicopter, the Iraqis turned to Russia and eventually sealed a $4.2 billion deal. We want Iraq to buy, train and maintain American.

Washington must also make the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad a priority again and work with Iraqis to keep Iran and Mr. Maliki on the sidelines. Federalism, heavily enshrined in the 2005 constitution, is the only way such a country can work; the Sunni areas need more autonomy. Mr. Abadi's work to bring sectarian militias (including at least 30,000 Sunnis) under the ministerial chain of command deserve support; some of these are blatant Iranian proxies, but Mr. Abadi is not. Kowtowing to the Persians is not a vote-winner in an Arab country.

Any Trump administration déente with Russia should not lead to tolerance for increased Iranian interference in Baghdad. Mr. Abadi's Iraq is emerging as a player on the global stage. As Russia increases its presence in the Mideast and sells itself as an alternative to the U.S., Iraq is one ally the Trump administration can't afford to lose.

Flynn's Early Departure; A transcript of the weekend's program on FOX News Channel.

Paul Gigot: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm Paul Gigot. A shake-up in the Trump White House this week with National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigning after reports of the transcripts of his December phone calls with Russia's ambassador were leaked and contradicted his claims made to White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, that sanctions were not discussed.

President Trump reacted to Flynn's ouster at a wild and wide-ranging press conference Thursday, defending his former national security advisor and condemning the leaks that led to his resignation.

President Donald Trump: Mike Flynn is a fine person and I asked for his resignation. He didn't have to do that because what he did wasn't wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.

Gigot: Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and Deputy Editor, Dan Henninger; Editorial Board Member, Mary Kissel; and Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman. So, we've got a lot to unpack here.

But let's start with the issue of whether or not it was right to ask for Mike Flynn's resignation, James.

James Freeman: Well, I would say no based on the information we have to date. 70 years ago, President Truman signed the National Security Act preventing intelligence agencies from spying on Americans.

This conversation happened while Mike Flynn was a private citizen before he took office. So, I don't know why this isn't the story. Why was the government listening to his conversation?

Gigot: All right. We want to get to that, but first of all Donald Trump said he fired him because he gave incomplete information to the vice president. If that's the case, can you - wasn't he justified in firing him in that instance?

Freeman: Well, there is a question there. (INAUDIBLE) they were discussing sanctions. And when the Russian official brought it up, did Mike Flynn discuss it or did he just vaguely say that they would have conversations about lots of things in the future?

But I really think it's important that there is not a constitutional or a legal requirement for Mike Flynn to always tell the truth to Mike Pence. I really hope that people start focusing on the bigger issue, which is what was he doing or why was he targeted.

Mary Kissel: I'm sorry. I have to respectfully disagree with my esteemed colleague James Freeman. Vice President Pence went on national television and told the nation that the issue of sanctions was not discussed between Gen. Flynn and the Russian ambassador and it's embarrassing to the vice president. He was misled. That in and of itself is reason to fire him.

Now, there's been other news that the vice president might have been willing to forgive him. That's great. He's a nice man. But when you go on national television and mislead the American public unknowingly, that is a firing offense.

Gigot: All right. Then let's unpack this a little more and get to the other issue, which is, what about the ties between Mike Flynn and other Trump officials and Russians in the campaign? That seems to be the big issue here that could dog the administration going forward? And you wrote this week, Dan, with a question mark, is this Donald Trump's Watergate. What did you mean by that?

Dan Henninger: Well, what I meant was, not so much that it's literally Watergate, but that it's beginning to be a Watergate-like atmosphere, which is to say, back then, there were a lot of anonymous sources writing about the Nixon administration. And what it meant is the Nixon presidency was thrown completely on the defensive. They spent all their time trying to respond to these stories, bombshells, alleging things that they had done.

Similarly, with the Trump presidency now, here we have Donald Trump at this press conference having to spend all this time talking about Mike Flynn. Presumably, the Trump presidency has an agenda that they want to - they have things to do. And if you get to the point where your presidency is always being pushed back by anonymous stories and the sort of undulating wave of negativity like this, then your presidency starts to get into trouble.

Gigot: Mary, what do we know so far? Just factual detail, the Russian ties with Flynn.

Kissel: We know very little. We know that Gen. Flynn spoke to the Russian ambassador several times. We know that sanctions were mentioned. We know Gen. Flynn did not disclose that to the vice president, allowed him to go on national television and make these statements and that President Trump fired him. That's what we know.

But there are a lot of known unknowns here.

Gigot: There's no transcripts that we've seen. We only have reports from government officials telling journalists what are in those transcripts.

Kissel: Exactly. Not only do we not - have we not seen the transcripts, we don't know the context of the conversation. We don't know if his phone was illegally tapped or if the government had a FISA warrant on him. Why didn't the FBI inform the Trump transition team before all of this came to light? There are a lot of known unknowns here.

Henninger: Somebody does know the answers to all these questions, which is to say the intelligence services. Look, if Mike Flynn was being investigated as a person of interest, then they had some reason for that. What do they have? Donald Trump should ask them to come into his office and lay it out on his desk, so that he at least understands what's going on.

Gigot: And, James, Trump made a very categorical denial of any relationship with Russia between himself and as far as he knew, he said, any of his officials. So, he's out there on a limb now. That's contradicted and there's any real ties and collusion shown, that might be an impeachable offense.

Freeman: Look, I really think talking impeachment and Watergate is way premature. We don't know anything yet.

Gigot: Of course, I'm saying we don't know anything, but if he's contradicted - that's my point.

Freeman: But I think - this is where the press corps, normally, you would hope, when they see the government spying on a private citizen, instead of immediately saying, oh, he must've done something really bad, you would hope they would say this is kind of an extreme measure, let's see the goods.

I agree, President Trump should've been asking the same thing. I think this demands an explanation. And, remember, how over the last ten years, how much people have freaked out over metadata collections not targeting any individual, no content of the calls, simply the times and circumstances of calls. And here we are, everyone seems to be shrugging their shoulders that this citizen was spied on.

Gigot: No, I think this is deeply troubling, James. I agree with you. And I think that the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees, which are investigating the Russian hacking and Russians influencing elections, need to put this on their agenda as well.

Still ahead, tensions with Moscow rising as a Russian spy ship was spotted off the East Coast of the United States. Is Vladimir Putting testing President Trump and how should he respond? We'll ask Ambassador John Bolton next.

President Trump: When you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you.

Gigot: Tensions with Russia are rising amid reports that Moscow has secretly deployed a new cruise missile, one that American officials say violates a 1987 arms control treaty. This, as a Russian spy ship was spotted this week off the East Coast of the United States.

President Trump was asked in his press conference Thursday if Russian President Vladimir Putin is testing him.

President Trump: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough - the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But, you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people and, to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.

Gigot: John Bolton is the former US ambassador to the United Nations and a Fox News contributor. Welcome, John.

Ambassador John Bolton: Glad to be with you.

Gigot: So, we should say, put on the record first to our viewers that the Wall Street Journal, we have said, you would make a fine national security advisor for President Trump. Get that off the table.

Now, Mike Flynn, did you think he had to go once it was disclosed that he had not provided complete information to the vice president.

Bolton: I don't think there was any alternative at that point. We, obviously, don't know what the conversation between Flynn and vice president was about. But if there is a breach of trust, it's not repairable.

I do think it's important to understand that the underlying conversation between Flynn and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak as far as has been reported was not problematic.

Gigot: There's nothing illegal about that happening.

Bolton: Or improper or unethical or anything else. So, what the purpose of the evasion or falsehood would've been is not clear to me.

Gigot: But would it have crossed a line if Flynn had said to him to the Russian, don't worry about the sanctions, we'll repeal them?

Bolton: Well, I think it would've been inadvisable to say that, but it would not have been improper. There's no allegation here that Flynn did anything to act as though Donald Trump was already president of the United States. That would've been a red line.

Every diplomat in Washington wanted to know at that point what the new Trump administration would do. They tell them some things. They don't tell them other things.

Gigot: Right, OK. All right. Now, looking historically, just step back a bit, who do you think was the best national security advisor to a modern president?

Bolton: Well, the most prominent was, obviously, Henry Kissinger because of his dominance of policy, but in terms of running the process, in my own experience, I would say Brent Scowcroft under Bush 41.

Gigot: Why?

Bolton: Because during the two preeminent crises of the Bush 41 administration, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of Yugoslavia - while we're on the subject - just a few things happened in that four-year - there was a lot going on.

And what Scowcroft did, I thought superbly, was manage a complex interagency process for a president who knew these issues intimately, but wanted to know what the facts were, what the arguments were, what his options were.

And I sat on the end of TV screens, I sat in meetings for countless hours during those four years, as did many others, and I just thought Scowcroft was masterful.

Gigot: So, you need that honest broker quality, so that everybody who has a point of view at a senior level gets to make his case and say, look, Mr. President, you've got to think about this and that. You don't want somebody who's going to be too secretive and close off debate.

Bolton: I think there's no perfect way to run this process, but the national security advisor, I do think has two preeminent functions. One, to make sure, on the input side, the president knows what he needs to know to make the best-informed decision. And then, on the output side, to make sure that when the president makes a decision, sometimes recalcitrant, even dissident agencies, carry it out.

Gigot: So, he's got to also be an implementer? Or an enforcer?

Bolton: And enforcer would be a better way to put it. Scowcroft himself famously reviewed the Iran Contra mess and made it clear the NSC should not be an operational agency.

Gigot: All right. Let's turn to Russia. Is it unusual to have a spy ship off the American coast?

Bolton: Well, it's unusual in recent years. But, look, it's in international waters. I think it's sort of putting a thumb to the nose. We do it too, not that I'm expressing moral equivalence, but everybody does this.

The real offensive behavior, I think this week, as you noted, was the deployment of this cruise missile, only one of many violations of the 1987 INF Treaty, this being the most recent.

Gigot: Yes, this is a medium-range missile and that was barred by that agreement with much fanfare. You and I both remember that very well. What do you think Putin is up to here? Is he basically saying stop me? See, what - I'm going to keep going until you do?

Bolton: I think that's exactly right. Look, they have been planning this, they've been upgrading their ballistic missile forces, their cruise missile forces, their nuclear arsenal under the New START Treaty that Obama signed and the Senate ratified. I think they are in effect threatening Western Europe with this. It was to safeguard Western Europe we agreed to the INF Treaty.

And, ironically, the only two countries in the world that are barred from manufacturing and deploying intermediate range missiles are ourselves and Russia, not China, not Iran, not North Korea. And Russia is violating the treaty. That means there's one nation that's constrained, us.

Gigot: Well, Jim Mattis, the Defense Secretary, was in Europe this week. We've got a lot of security talks this week in Europe. And he basically said, in addition to telling NATO countries, you better start paying more for defense or the Americans are going to have some doubts about whether we want to continue spending as much as we are, he also really threw some cold water on the idea of a grand bargain with Russia. And he said, their behavior is going to have to change first.

What is your sense of the likelihood of some kind of bargain between Trump and Putin where Putin says, OK, I'll help you with ISIS, Islamic State, in return for getting rid of sanctions?

Bolton: Well, I wouldn't make that bargain because I don't think it's - you've got equivalents there in the terms of what's happening. I think Russia's behaved objectionably in Eastern and Central Europe. I think it's behaving objectionably in the Middle East. And ISIS alone, as important as its destruction is, shouldn't give the Russians a pass on those Ukraine- related sanctions.

I thought Mattis did a good job in articulating the point that we expect the NATO members in Europe to pay more without threatening the end of the alliance. And we'll see more on that discussion this weekend.

Gigot: All right, John Bolton. Thanks. We're going to hold the ambassador over for our next block. Still had, another early test of the Trump administration's foreign policy as the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is assassinated. We'll take a closer look at the threat posed by that increasingly unstable regime when we come back.

Gigot: Another rogue nation seemingly testing the new administration with the estranged half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly assassinated this week, poisoned at an airport in Malaysia.

The bizarre episode follows last weekend's test firing of a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, a launch that coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit with President Trump. We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Ambassador John Bolton.

So, Mary, obviously, nobody knows for sure who ordered the hit, but it does look like it could have been ordered - probably was ordered from Pyongyang.

Kissel: Yes. I think that's a fair assumption, Paul. Kim Jong-nam was living under China's protection in Macau, and so it's significant that he was killed outside of Macau in a third country. He had made reform-minded statements. He was being protected by China as possibly someone who could come in and take over North Korea as China's puppet sometime in the future.

But, Paul, it's important to understand, North Korea's regime rests on bloodlines. This is a very risky move by Kim Jong-un to take out his half- brother.

Gigot: And he previously killed his uncle who was potentially a threat.

Kissel: That's right. And it's, again, important to note that the uncle was close to China. So, I think you are seeing a continuation of a theme here and you're seeing a leader in Pyongyang who perhaps is still consolidating his power even though he has been on the throne for years.

Gigot: John, how do you read this in terms of the stability overall of the regime?

Bolton: Well, I think it's extraordinary that they carried out this assassination in a foreign country. It's one thing to kill your uncle in North Korea. So what?

But I think it shows why the population of South Korea over the past several years has gotten increasingly nervous about the threat from the North and the erratic behavior of the leadership, thus strengthening our ability to deploy theater missile defenses, but also to convince the South Koreans to be much more worried about the North Korean nuclear program.

Gigot: But there's a South Korean under an impeachment fight and the next president of Korea, the next year - elected within a year or so could be more dovish.

Bolton: No, if anything, I think this shows you've got instability in the North and the South and, therefore, the risk of something going awry in a leadership contest in the North, while the South is paralyzed, is significant.

Gigot: Dan, two missile launches since the Trump presidency began. How do you think Trump should respond to the next one?

Henninger: It's a real scorpion dance here with the North Koreans and how to respond to them. Look, they have got nuclear capabilities. As crazy as the regime is, they have the ability to build nuclear weapons and to launch missiles.

So, there is something formidable inside North Korea. Now, people argue all the time that the Chinese are the people who should be leaning on the North Koreans. And there is talk about sanctioning Chinese companies that do business with the North Koreans.

But Donald Trump also has other fish to fry with the Chinese. There is the South China Sea. There's the trade talks that he wants to take on with them. So, all of this is intertwined. If policy towards North Korea is going to include the Chinese taking action against them -

Gigot: We've been leaning on the Chinese to help us with Korea for how long, Mary?

Kissel: For years and - for 30 years. Look, you could return North Korea to the list of the state sponsor of terrorism. You could enact secondary sanctions as we did with Banco Delta Asia, a Chinese bank that was doing business with North Korea that we know that that really hurts the regime.

We could use the UN report on human rights and really push the rights agenda. We know that that really riled the leadership.

And we can encourage more defections. We've had some very senior defections in recent years.

Let's air drop notes into North Korea and tell them that we support them. We want them to have a better life. There are a number of things that we could do on a sliding scale.

Gigot: Three administrations that I know of have done - tried the same policy of - they've tried many different policies. They've tried sanctions. They've tried engagement. They've tried bribery. None of it has worked. Republican and Democratic.

What should we do differently than what we have been doing to stop the nuclear program in Korea?

Henninger: Yes. Look, I think over a 25-year period, through different policies, though, it's been a consistent effort to negotiate North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. And that means 25 years of failure.

Year 26 of negotiations is not going to produce a different result. Therefore, you have to think of something larger than simply dealing with the nuclear program. And I have believed for some time the only real way to resolve this problem is to reunite the two Koreas. Now, that's not easy -

Gigot: A regime change in the North basically.

Henninger: With China's help. And I do think that China does have the wherewithal through the oil it provides, the food and other humanitarian necessities. They fear a collapse in North Korea that would put American troops on the Yalu River. Conveniently, we don't want American troops on the Yalu River. We want them somewhere else. And China fears a human wave of refugees into China.

Gigot: Yes. So how do we get to work with them?

Henninger: We could change their behavior, China's behavior. There are signs that many Chinese leaders understand what an ugly piece of baggage this regime is. Now, this is going to be hard. I wish we had started 15 years ago. We may not have enough time to convince China that their ultimate long-range interest is a reunited Korea.

Gigot: All right. Thank you all. Still ahead, the left and right unite to take on a Trump cabinet nominee. So, what was behind Andy Puzder's fall? And will the president's labor secretary pick fare better in the Senate?

Gigot: President Trump on Thursday announced former US attorney Alexander Acosta as his new pick for labor secretary, just a day after Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination. Puzder, a fast food executive, who faced mounting opposition from both the left and the right, pulled out of consideration on the eve of his confirmation hearing after as many as a dozen Republican senators expressed reservations about his nomination.

We're back with Dan Henninger and Mary Kissel; Wall Street Journal Editorial Page Editor, Allysia Finley; and Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman also joins the panel.

So, Dan, what took down Andy Puzder?

Henninger: What took down Andy Puzder was timidity by the Republicans who were under assault both by the unions and more notably by the ant- immigration right, which said that Puzder was a little bit too sympathetic to the idea of bringing in immigrants on a legal basis to work for small industries and so forth.

Gigot: So, now, legal immigration is a black bag. You can't favor legal immigration and serve in the Trump cabinet?

Henninger: As of the Puzder nomination, the answer to that is yes. And as that gets resolved, that's where we sit now.

Gigot: How do you read it, Allysia? You were reporting this for us. My sources suggest that maybe some people inside the Trump White House were willing to say, yes, you can push him over and may have signaled to Breitbart and some of these restrictionist voices in conservative media that you can open season on Puzder.

Allysia Finley: I think that's right. I think he got caught in the crossfire between the union left and the restrictionist right. They used the fact that he had hired an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper long ago against him, even though once he learned about her status, he had fired her and helped her procure legal assistance to become documented.

Gigot: Right. But that attack from some on the conservative right did scare Republican senators.

Finley: I think that's right. They got - a lot of them got - as many as 12 got cold feet and they asked the White House be spared from having to take a vote on him.

Gigot: The danger for Trump, Mary, shows Republicans don't seem to - in the Senate, don't seem to be all that afraid of disagreeing with him and taking down one of his nominees. And the White House didn't lift a finger really to help Puzder.

Kissel: Yes, I thought that was interesting. You go back through the Trump tweets and there weren't tweets about Puzder. Lots of tweets about Ivanka, but Andy Puzder, well, you know -

Gigot: He's only a cabinet officer.

Kissel: He's only a cabinet officer. Who cares? I guess the loss too with Andy Puzder is that he was deep into the weeds of all of the really terrible regulations that were issued under the Obama administration.

Obscure things like the persuader rule and the fiduciary rule. Hundreds and hundreds of pages that really put a damper on business investment in this country. So, he could have done a lot of good. Thankfully, he's nominated a guy who, I think, is equally as qualified.

Gigot: Let me ask about that James Freeman. Alexander Acosta, how do you feel about him as a replacement for Puzder?

Freeman: Yes. He's good stuff, an experienced Washington hand. Good pick. But I think this is a real loss with Andy Puzder and it's really inexplicable this lack of courage on the part of Senate Republicans because I know Donald Trump has said a lot of things over the last year and earlier that make it difficult for them to stand next to him.

Not so with Andy Puzder. This was a very well-informed, articulate critic of Obamacare, of the overtime rules that really kind of discourage ambitious young people who want to work hard and put in some sweat equity, a very articulate critic of the minimum wage -

Gigot: All true, James. All true. But when you've got the left firing at him and the right firing at him and the White House basically marshals no defense, what are you going to do in the Republican Senate?

Freeman: I mean, you've got to shoot back when the left is firing at them. You know they hate him for all of these reasons we've been talking about, along with the fact that he serves up big hunks of red meat instead of - as he told Allysia Finley a few years ago, it's not a restaurant chain for people who want to eat nuts and bark. Everyone about this guy offended the left and that's why you would have hoped for a more aggressive response from Senate Republicans -

Gigot: I think you're aiming at the wrong target. Senate Republicans, sure, they got weak-kneed, but if your White House is not defending your nominee, Allysia - I talked to Puzder's people and what they told me is that if it weren't for Puzder's PR firm, you had nothing else.

Finley: Right. Nobody even (INAUDIBLE) any meetings with him and the Senators. There was no liaison or anything. They just let him hang out there to dry.

Gigot: And this suggests to me, this is the sign - despite the fact that Trump says we're a finetuned machine, the White House, this is not fine- tuned or even a machine when you let your nominee like this to hang out.

Freeman: Well, it's only four or five moving parts. It can't be fine- tuned. But they're understaffed and they just didn't have the people in place to organize a support for somebody like Andy Puzder and that shows the inherent weaknesses of not putting the government together sufficiently.

Kissel: Can I insert some sunshine into this gloom and doom. Alex Acosta is a very accomplished guy. He's been confirmed by the Senate three times. He effectively neuters every attack Sen. Elizabeth Warren is going to levy at him because he has prosecuted the banks that she hates and he's endorsed by groups like (INAUDIBLE) on the left that she adores. I don't think he's going to have trouble getting confirmed. And I think he will be just as pro-market - pro-free market rather as Puzder would have been.

Gigot: Yes. I know Alex Acosta and I think he's a very good choice, Allysia. How do you read his background?

Finley: I would agree. I think the irony here is he's also been very supportive of immigrants and immigrant rights and increasing immigrant access to public services.

So, the restrictionist right did not proclaim victory here.

Gigot: All right. Thank you very much. Still ahead, the fight for the future of the Democratic Party, playing out in the race for DNC chair. So, will the Clinton or Sanders wings prevail in next week's vote?

Gigot: The fight for the future of the Democratic Party is heating up ahead of next week's vote for DNC chair. And after a contentious 2016 primary, the battle between Clinton and Sanders wings of the party is on full display with former Labor Secretary Tom Perez boasting the support of fellow Obama administration colleagues like Joe Biden and Eric Holder and his chief rival Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison locking up the endorsements of both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Doug Schoen is a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President Bill Clinton. He joins me now from Los Angeles.

So, Doug, you wrote, I think it was this week that the party - the Democratic Party is literally on life support. Is it really that bad?

Doug Schoen: It is, Paul. Look, we have been steadily losing offices, we've been losing statehouses and governorships in the last eight years. The state parties themselves are moribund and the strategy that the activist wing has taken, this resist Trump, is something that is bereft of policy, it involves demonstrations and frankly attacking other Democrats who have the temerity to want to even sit and listen and potentially work with the new administration.

I think, Paul, very simply it's madness, politically and socially and economically.

Gigot: Tell us how you really feel, Doug. I want to get to this resistance strategy and what should - a little later. Let's get with the DNC chair fight first. Is this really - did I frame it correctly by calling it a fight between basically be the Obama/Clinton wing on the one hand with Perez and the Sanders/Warren wing on the other with Ellison.

Schoen: Yes. I think that's exactly right. Ellison opened an early lead. There are reports from the Perez camp that they've got 180 of the 244 votes they will need. Those are heartily and enthusiastically dismissed by the Ellison camp.

And the Ellison camp has literally been in the streets attacking Democrats who are opposed to keep Ellison and are willing to work with the Trump administration. And there is real possibility that the vote could be actively disrupted, which no matter who wins, Paul, could be a bad note for the Democrats.

Gigot: But I have to tell you, if you look at the platforms of both of these guys, both of these candidates, it is Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There is no real difference fundamentally, it seems to me, between what they believe ideologically.

Schoen: Well, that's why I wrote in your newspaper that I thought the Democratic Party was heading in a calamitously wrong direction. I think if you emphasize redistribution over growth and confrontation over conciliation, you will continue to lose that working class vote in the Midwest that the Democrats need with 10 senators up in states that President Trump won.

The Democrats can ill afford moving to the hard left. And candidly, I see my party moving in a direction that is virtually unrecognizable.

Gigot: Yes. But, look, why not - let's get to the point about resistance. The strategy does seem to be resistance. But if you are sitting in the House and the Senate and you're a Democrat and you watch the women's march on inauguration weekend and then you've watched what's happened with the Trump administration and the protests against him by Democratic activists, what choice do you have? How can you resist a base that is that activated against the president?

Schoen: Well, that is exactly what led people like Senator Schumer, the minority leader, to go from I can work with President Trump to say he's going to oppose virtually all his legislation and nominees. And in the short term, it makes sense; in the longer term, I think it is a very bad and destructive strategy.

Gigot: But my point is - my question is, does Schumer really have a choice because if he goes in any other direction and starts to - try to cooperate, isn't he at risk of being - having protests against him? So, if you are Schumer, isn't this the easiest path to pursue?

Schoen: Yes, it's the easiest path and indeed there have been demonstrations already outside his house in Park Slope, Brooklyn. But I am not convinced it's a winning strategy.

Look, when I worked for Bill Clinton, we took the party back to the center away from the left, balanced budget, welfare reform, crime control and we need a party that continues to reposition itself, not embraces activism and left-wing redistributive politics that is out of touch with the American people.

Gigot: All right. But here is what I hear from a lot of Democrats. Look, the Tea Party strategy of 2010, which was a resistance to President Obama, that worked beautifully in 2010. We took back the House. We picked up seats in the Senate.

Why shouldn't the same thing work for the Democrats this time in 2018? After all, it looks like the Trump administration is having some difficulties and Republicans haven't put any victories legislatively on the table so far? So, why not go for total resistance?

Schoen: Well, because the voters in the ten states or so that are Trump states that Democrats have senators up and congressmen - as well congressional seats that are open and available for contesting, they are much more moderate to conservative.

This is a moderate to conservative country. And to just be in the streets with activism is not reflecting the base they are trying to reach, which is what did happen in 2010. The conservative wing of the Republican Party, the now Tea Party or freedom wing did reflect activists. I don't believe that working-class voters who voted for Donald Trump have a lot of sympathy with the so-called resistance wing and I think we'll see that two years from now on election day.

Gigot: All right. Doug, thanks for being here. Good to have you. When we come back, after five years of drought, California deals with a fallout from this winter's record rainfall and its strain on the state's aging infrastructure. So, do Governor Jerry Brown and President Donald Trump finally agree on something?

Gov. Jerry Brown: I was very glad to see President Trump announce his $1 trillion infrastructure program which I fully embrace.

Infrastructure is profoundly important. And in our complex society, whether it's electricity or gas or water or roads or bridges, there's a lot to be done. And we're not talking about a few million, we're talking about tens of billions. And that is why I was really glad to see President Trump announce his $1 trillion infrastructure program, which I fully embrace.

Gigot: California Governor Jerry Brown getting behind President Trump's trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. After nearly 200,000 people in Northern California were urged to evacuate last weekends, fleeing the rising waters and crumbling spillways of the nation's tallest dam.

Residents of the community surrounding the Oroville Dam were allowed to return to their homes on Tuesday. But officials say the crisis is not over as record rainfall is putting California on track for its wettest winter on record.

We're back with Dan Henninger, Allysia Finley and James Freeman. So, Allysia, I thought that California was in drought and they would welcome rainfall. It doesn't look like actually the drought is over.

Finley: Look, the state won't declare the drought over because they want people to conserve. We're on track for the wettest winter on record. Precipitation is twice the average. Up and down the state, reservoirs are overflowing with water. So, they're having to release water, which they can't store because they don't have enough reservoirs. So, the issue right now, there's too much precipitation.

Gigot: But this is a normal California weather pattern from my reading of history. It's a dry climate, but then - and you get to dry, dry, dry, dry and then suddenly you get these very wet seasons, very wet years which we've had this year and to some extent last year.

Finley: Right. It's a cyclical pattern and this is why they need to build more reservoirs. And farmers, in particularly, having to be pushing to build more reservoirs to store the water when you have these storm surges, so they can tap the water during these dry years.

Gigot: And why is the Oroville spillway failing? I guess it's never been used in -

Finley: The emergency spillway hasn't been used since it was finished in 1968.

Gigot: So, nobody really even knew if it would work?

Finley: It would work, right.

Gigot: Is it is just an infrastructure failure or is this - in the sense that is this is a failure of the federal member, state governments to actually focus on the public works projects or is it something else?

Finley: Nobody knows. There's going to be an investigation. Nobody knows exactly what caused. It was relicensed in 2005. It was met all the specification for the federal government and state regulators. They thought it was in fine shape. So, nobody - environmentalists who say (INAUDIBLE) we need to be spending more on maintaining our damns, well, that's not necessarily the reason why this happened.

Gigot: Because, James, this seems to be a question of priorities. If you're going to spend $65 billion on a train, a bullet train that is highly controversial between Los Angeles and San Francisco, you're not going to spend money on something else.

Freeman: Yes. I think this is maybe - it has to do with that old saying about how you want to be prepared for at least the possibility of success.

There was so much whining about the drought and perhaps they were believing their rhetoric that this was some sort of new state of affairs under climate change that here we are - this infrastructure that Jerry Brown is talking so much about, of course, you can't build it in California because when this emergency money goes out there, we're going to find endless environmental impact statements, years of lawsuits, people wanting to protect the delta smelt and other beloved critters. It's going to be a problem. Even if you now have some rising political will to make sure you have enough reservoir capacity -

Henninger: Well, speaking of political will, James, this is something we hope the Trump White House is following because they are talking about $1 trillion infrastructure bill. And what happened here gives you an idea of what will commence once that gets put in play. There's so much politics, so many environmental issues, local politicians who want things built in their backyard, people who don't want things built in their backyard, as a result, infrastructure never gets addressed. It's going to be a very heavy lift for Donald Trump.

Gigot: And some environmentalists, Allysia, they don't even want any dam.

Finley: They hate dams. So, they're just blaming, look, climate change is going to put more stress on our infrastructure and dams. They're going to fail. We shouldn't build any more dams - period. And we should destroy the ones that already exist.

Gigot: All right. So, who should build - who should rebuild the spillway because I assume that's going to get done. Federal government or California?

Finley: The state. The state has money. It has an $8 billion rainy day fund. What is the rainy day fund for essentially?

Freeman: Literally, a rainy day.

Gigot: Yes, a rainy day. All right, we take to take one more break. When we come back, hits and misses of the week.

Gigot: Time now for our hits and misses of the week. Mary, start us off.

Kissel: Well, Paul, I am giving a hit to the Trump administration for reversing President Obama's policy of indulgence towards that criminal state to our south, Venezuela, and putting the vice president of Venezuela on the blacklist and bringing the wife of jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, bringing her into the White House for a photo op with the president and the vice president. I think it's absolutely terrific. Now, let's do more.

Gigot: OK. James?

Freeman: Paul, this is a miss too. America's colleges and universities, as you know, they've been raising prices faster than inflation for decades. A big reason why student loan debt in the last ten years has gone from less than $500 billion to $1.3 trillion and now they are saying increasingly at a number of campuses they do not want to give kids credit for advanced placement scores that they do in high school. And I think we ought to be skeptical here because if kids are able to complete college in three years instead of four, obviously, that's bad for business.

Gigot: And parents who want to pay less tuition. Allysia?

Finley: This is a miss to the New York City MPA. There was a new report this week that subway delays have increased by 150 percent in the last four years. Meanwhile, fares are going to go up again next week - next month. So, you pay more for worst service. How New York is that?

Gigot: All right. Dan?

Henninger: Well, I'm giving my hit to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who is trying to hold the NATO alliance together. And he was over there saying they have got to step up and start spending the 2% of GDP that they promised. We spend 3.6% of GDP. That accounts for about two-thirds of all the spending in the alliance. And Jim Mattis said, look, if you don't it, we're not going to promise as Donald Trump has been suggesting that we're going to be able to be there for you. Good news is the Germans, the Danish and the Dutch all said publicly Gen. Mattis has a point, we have to pay our fair share.

Gigot: Right now, Britain, Estonia, Poland and Greece and the US are the only ones who make it.

Henninger: That's right.

Gigot: All right. Thank you all. And, remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us at @JERonFNC. That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. And thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week.

World News: U.S. Isn't After Iraq's Oil, Mattis Says --- American defense chief, on visit to region, will assess efforts in fight against Islamic State

BAGHDAD -- Jim Mattis, ahead of his first trip to Iraq as defense secretary, said he plans to assess the fight against Islamic State in the country and that the U.S. isn't there to take its oil.

"I think all of us here in this room, all of us in America, have paid for our gas and oil all along and I'm sure that we will continue to do so in the future," he told reporters in Abu Dhabi before arriving in Iraq on Monday, part of a seven-day visit to the Middle East. "We are not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil."

The comments by Mr. Mattis are at odds with remarks made repeatedly by President Donald Trump.

Speaking to employees at the Central Intelligence Agency on Jan. 21, Mr. Trump doubled down on campaign rhetoric in which he suggested the U.S. should have taken the oil in exchange for U.S. battlefield sacrifices there.

"The old expression, to the victor belonged the spoils, you remember, they always used to say, keep the oil. If we kept the oil, you probably wouldn't have ISIS, because that's where they made money in the first place," he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. "Should have kept the oil."

Mr. Trump then hinted at the possibility of future operations in the country where the U.S. might do just that. "Maybe you'll have another chance," he said.

While the comments have stirred controversy, Mr. Trump has toyed with policy positions publicly, on Twitter and in speeches, only to back down on some.

On his second overseas trip as defense secretary, Mr. Mattis has sought to reassure allies in Europe about America's commitment to collective security.

He is in Iraq to conduct his own assessment of its security and political situation and the fight to oust Islamic State, he said.

The Sunni Muslim extremist group swept through Iraq in summer 2014, seizing roughly one-third of its territory.

Iraqi forces and the U.S. coalition battling the group in Iraq and Syria have since dealt it a series of battlefield defeats that have shrunk its area of control.

In October, they launched their biggest offensive to date in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and an Islamic State stronghold, and have driven it from the city's eastern side.

On Monday, Iraqi ground forces took a key village on the edge the city, reaching the outskirts of the airport as part of a renewed advance.

The security forces pushed into the village of Albo Saif, the first major obstacle to retaking western Mosul from militants, according to military officials. The village sits on high ground and serves as a southern approach to the airport and a sprawling military base used by the Iraqi military before the city fell to Islamic State more than two years ago.

Mr. Trump asked for a review of the fight against Islamic State as part of his push to accelerate the fight. Mr. Mattis is expected to provide his assessment in the coming days.

"We're going into Iraq because I need to get current" on the political enemy and military situation there, he told reporters, "and put it all together in my mind and the only way to do that is to talk to the people responsible there on the ground, that would be the Iraqi political leadership, our partner in this fight."

"We're going to make certain that we have good shared situational awareness of what we face as we work together, fight alongside each other and to destroy ISIS," he added.

Mr. Mattis has had a moderating effect on the commander-in-chief, persuading him -- for now -- that torture isn't an effective battlefield tool.

Mr. Trump said recently that while he doesn't agree with his defense secretary on torture, he would defer to him.

A January executive order by Mr. Trump that temporarily banned entry to the U.S. from citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included Iraq, and has further fueled Baghdad's concerns about relations, including the fate of interpreters and other Iraqis who have worked with U.S. troops there.

Mr. Trump said the measure was intended to curb the risk of terrorists entering the country. The White House is currently rewriting the order after it was suspended by a federal judge.

"I have not seen the new executive order, but right now I am assured that we will take steps to allow those who fight alongside us for example to be allowed into the United States," Mr. Mattis said. "They will be vetted, obviously, by their performance on the battlefield beside us and I'm sure we'll work through this quickly."

トランプ氏、断ち切れぬ「中国批判」の危険な誘惑

――投資家のための専門誌「バロンズ」のコラム

＊＊＊

　ドナルド・トランプ米大統領が貿易戦争を始めるのではないかとの懸念は、2月に入って大きく後退した。トランプ氏と中国の習近平国家主席との電話会談は、対決色よりも融和色が強かった。さらに、トランプ氏がフロリダ州の別荘に招いた安倍晋三首相との親密ぶりは、日本の政府関係者を安堵（あんど）させた。

　トランプ氏が貿易政策を巡り中国に対してドル安誘導という最終手段に訴えることはないとの見方が広がりつつあるが、市場はそれをうのみにしてはならない。調査会社ゲイブカル・ドラゴノミクスのアーサー・クローバー氏は、トランプ氏の姿勢があからさまに軟化したのは「人事」が原因であって、それをそのまま真に受けることはできないと警告する。トランプ氏が通商政策の実務を担うキーパーソンとして指名した商務長官候補のウィルバー・ロス氏が上院で承認されれば、その後は中国との対立が待ち構えている、というのが同氏の見立てだ。

　筆者の考えは違う。トランプ氏は、国内の不祥事から目を背けさせるには中国を激しく非難すれば良い、と考えるのではないだろうか。この戦術は中国に有利に働くことが多いとしてもだ。

　トランプ政権は早くも混乱の極みにある。難民・移民の入国を制限する大統領令は「反イスラム」的と受け止められた。安全保障担当のマイケル・フリン大統領補佐官は、就任前にロシア大使と接触していた疑いで事実上解任された。労働長官候補のアンディ・パズダー氏は指名を辞退した。さらに、事実と現実を巡る問題が後を絶たない。こうした問題から注意をそらす方法として、中国やアジア諸国に難癖を付けるよりもましな方法はないのだろうか。

　難題を抱えるトランプ政権は、「本末転倒（英語はワグ・ザ・ドッグ＝しっぽが犬を振る）」な行為に訴える誘惑があまりにも大きすぎ（そして、あまりにも明白すぎて）、それに負けるかもしれない。

　この点に関しては筆者の考えが間違っていて欲しいが、トランプ氏はアジアの各国首脳の手法を踏襲している形跡がいくつも見受けられる。トランプ氏が米空調大手キャリアのメキシコ移転を助成金給付などで阻止したことは、「日本株式会社」を手本としている。トランプ氏のこうした対応は短期的なメリットこそあれ、長期的には経済的なインセンティブを悪い方向へゆがませるものだ。トランプ氏のメディアに対する感情的な攻撃や「もう一つの事実」戦法は、あまりにも中国のやり方に似ている。これは到底安心できない。何でもかんでも被害者を装う戦術は、マレーシアが得意とするところだ。政治とファミリービジネスをあからさまに混同する姿は、タイのタクシン・チナワット元首相を想起させる。そして政策面の変わり身の早さは、フィリピンのロドリゴ・ドゥテルテ大統領の手法を思い起こさせる。

　トランプ氏は都合の悪いことが起きるたび、国民の注意をそらす方法として軍事行動に頼るかもしれない。その場合は、シリアへの地上部隊派遣や過激派組織「イスラム国（ISIS）」への大規模空爆が選択肢となろう。南シナ海で挑発行動に出ることも考えられる。トランプ氏が中国製品に2桁の関税を課すと同時に、南シナ海に建設された「海軍基地（中国政府は基地建設を否定している）」に向けて空母を派遣すれば、支持者は喜び、米政権の問題は注目度が下がるだろう。異母兄の金正男（キム・ジョンナム）氏の殺害を指示したとされる金正恩（キム・ジョンウン）朝鮮労働党委員長が率いる北朝鮮も格好の標的となりそうだ。

　もう1度繰り返すが、筆者のこうした考えは間違いであってほしい。だが、トランプ氏は、報道陣の目をそらすためツイッターで繰り返し大言壮語を吐いてきた。実際に政治危機に直面したトランプ氏がこの戦術を海外で用いかねない、と考えてもおかしくない。

　このリスクは習主席にも当てはまる。中国政府は、本土の大気汚染の原因となっている製造業中心の経済から、サービス業中心の経済に移行しようとしているが、それが意味するのは経済成長の大幅な鈍化だ。スタンダード・ライフ・インベストメンツのエコノミスト、アレックス・ウルフ氏が指摘するように、中国は「政治の不透明さに加え、民間投資を大幅に落ち込ませた住宅市場の調整に苦しんでいる」。

　中国共産党にとって、これはまさに綱渡りの政策運営だ。中国経済を年7％のペースで成長させ、所得拡大を持続させなければ、共産党の正当性は揺らぎかねない。社会不安に陥るリスクが高まっているため、習政権は愛国主義に訴える戦略や検閲を強化してきた。例えば、15年に上海株式相場が暴落した際には、中国政府に打撃を与えることを狙った海外勢力の仕業という陰謀説を国営メディアが広めた。

　その後も、政府系メディアは日本など近隣諸国を批判することで共産党の求心力を高めようとしてきた。中国が領有権を主張する南シナ海上空に防空識別圏を設定しようとしたり、ベトナム近海に石油採掘装置を設置したり、アジア海域で大規模な建設プロジェクトを進めようとしたりしている習政権を国営メディアは称賛している。国民の視線を賃金の伸び鈍化や環境汚染から地政学的問題に向けさせたいという誘惑は、習政権もトランプ政権も同じくらい大きい。

　トランプ氏が中国を「攻撃」する場合、どのような方法が考えられるだろうか。ゲイブカル・ドラゴノミクスのクローバー氏はヤンメイ・シェ氏との共同リポートで、輸入税の導入、為替操作国への認定、鉄鋼など過剰生産力を輸出している産業への反ダンピング措置などを組み合わせたものになると指摘している。クローバー氏らは、政治的には一定の成果があるかもしれないが、「そのような対立は米国に不利な結果となる公算が大きい。中国に対する敵対的な措置は、さまざまな実務的・法的リスクをもたらし、中国から強い抵抗にあうだろう。しかも、トランプ政権が長期戦略を構築している様子はほとんど見られない」と述べている。

　一方、米大統領選でトランプ氏が当選する数週間前に、映画「ウワサの真相／ワグ・ザ・ドッグ」の原作者、ラリー・バインハート氏が「トランポノミクス（トランプ氏の経済政策）」に異を唱えていたというのは示唆に富んでいる。バインハート氏は中東の衛星テレビ局アルジャジーラ（電子版）で、「トランプ氏が中国やメキシコ、日本、ベトナムから雇用を取り戻したとしても、同氏が引き上げ不要と考える最低賃金を超える額を雇用主が（従業員に）支払う理由などあるだろうか」と指摘していた。だが、今の段階ですでに疑問視されている計画が拙速に取りまとめられ、苦し紛れに発表されたら、いったいどうなるだろうか。経済に赤信号が再びともるのだろうか。トランプ政権からはもっとばかげた措置が打ち出されている。しかもその政権は発足からまだ1カ月しかたっていない。

Jim Mattis Says U.S. Isn't in Iraq to Take Its Oil; U.S. defense secretary is to assess the fight against Islamic State

The U.S. isn't in Iraq to seize anybody's oil, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Monday, deviating from comments by President Donald Trump ahead of a visit to the country, where American troops are now operating closer to the front line against Islamic State.

Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general who led troops into battle during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, made the comments to reporters in Abu Dhabi before arriving Monday in Baghdad to assess the fight against Islamic State in Iraq.

"I think all of us here in this room, all of us in America, have paid for our gas and oil all along and I'm sure that we will continue to do so in the future," he told reporters. "We are not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil."

The comments by Mr. Mattis, on a seven-day visit to the Middle East, are at odds with remarks made repeatedly by Mr. Trump, who said as recently as last month that the U.S. should have taken Iraq's oil.

Speaking to employees at the Central Intelligence Agency on Jan. 21, Mr. Trump doubled down on campaign rhetoric in which he suggested the U.S. should have taken the oil in exchange for U.S. battlefield sacrifices there.

"The old expression, to the victor belonged the spoils, you remember, they always used to say, keep the oil," he said. "If we kept the oil, you probably wouldn't have ISIS, because that's where they made money in the first place," he added, using an acronym for Islamic State. Mr. Trump also hinted at the possibility of future operations in the country where the U.S. might do just that.

Meanwhile, as U.S. forces assisted Iraqi forces in western Mosul, the top commander there said U.S. troops were operating under less restrictive rules than they had been.

Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, acknowledged Monday that American troops are operating closer to the front lines of combat as they assist Iraqi forces, a significant loosening of the restrictions under which the military operated under during the Obama administration.

"It is true that we are operating closer and deeper into the Iraqi formation," Lt. Gen. Townsend said at a briefing at the military airport in Baghdad. "We adjusted our posture during the east Mosul fight and embedded advisers a bit further down into the formation."

Officials said the Pentagon used existing authorities provided under the previous administration but never before used to loosen the restrictions, allowing U.S. troops to operate with more latitude. Lt. Gen. Townsend said American forces, including combat advisers, trainers and others, are tied more closely to Iraqi forces than they had been.

The timing of the change suggests that the military was empowered by the election of Mr. Trump, who signaled a desire for a more aggressive fight against Islamic State. The Obama administration had sought to keep U.S. troops away from the front lines, an approach that at times frustrated the Pentagon.

U.S. military officials said that despite the adjustment, Iraqi forces remain in the lead and U.S. forces remain in an advise and assist role. Iraqi officials reiterate that sentiment.

The change gives trainers and advisers more latitude to work closely with Iraqi forces. It also provides permission for forces known as "forward air controllers" who help call in airstrikes, to conduct operations at a far more tactical level than before. The change pertains to about 450 troops across Iraq, according to Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S. command in Baghdad.

Another separate change gives lower-level commanders, including one- and two-star generals, the power to approve airstrikes in some cases, a delegation of authority down from a three-star general or above.

The public acknowledgment of the changes comes as Iraqi and U.S. troops resume the campaign to remove Islamic State fighters from western Mosul after a weekslong pause in combat, Iraq's second largest city is the Sunni extremist group's last major Iraqi stronghold.

A January executive order by Mr. Trump that temporarily banned entry to the U.S. from citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included Iraq, and has further fueled Baghdad's concerns about relations, including the fate of interpreters and other Iraqis who have worked with U.S. troops.

Mr. Trump said the measure was intended to curb the risk of terrorists entering the U.S. The White House is currently rewriting the order after it was suspended by a federal court.

"I have not seen the new executive order, but right now I am assured that we will take steps to allow those who fight alongside us for example to be allowed into the United States," Mr. Mattis said. "They will be vetted, obviously, by their performance on the battlefield beside us, and I'm sure we'll work through this quickly."

The Trump administration's mixed signals on Iraq come as American troops help local forces, including Iraqi armed forces and Kurdish Peshmerga troops, work to push Islamic State out of the country.

U.S.-backed troops have already ousted the extremist group from the eastern part of the city, but the density of the western side, across the Tigris River, poses challenges to the Iraqi forces and their American advisers, according to U.S. military officials.

Iraq's military, with air support from the U.S.-led coalition, restarted its offensive Sunday morning on the city after a pause in the campaign to retake Mosul, an effort that began in October.

The delay in operations stemmed in part from the heavy casualties taken by Iraqi special forces who slogged through much of the house-to-house fighting on the city's east side.

Iraqi ground forces took a key village on the edge of Mosul on Monday, reaching the outskirts of the city's airport as part of the renewed advance.

The Iraqi security forces pushed into the village of Albu Saif, the first major obstacle to retaking western Mosul from militants, according to military officials. The village sits on high ground and serves as a southern approach to the airport and a sprawling military base, which the Iraqi military used before the city fell to Islamic State in 2014.

The renewed assault on eastern Mosul comes as the Pentagon follows through on Mr. Trump's Jan. 28 executive order, which gives Mr. Mattis no more than 30 days to outline ways for the U.S. to accelerate the campaign against Islamic State and provide his official assessment of the military operation.

Mr. Mattis is expected to consider loosening restrictions under which the U.S. military forces operate even further. The Pentagon chief will also look at changes to intelligence sharing, battlefield logistics and tactics, he said Monday.

While in Iraq on Monday, Mr. Mattis emphasized that Iraqi forces were bearing the brunt of the fight against Islamic State militants and praised the progress the country's military has made, with the help of U.S. and other coalition members, in defeating the extremists.

"This is not something that was a foregone conclusion for an army that only a year ago many people were questioning," Mr. Mattis said. He said the U.S.-Iraqi military relationship, which has had highs and lows in the past, would endure.

"This is a partnership," Mr. Mattis said. "There have been a lot of rocky times out here, I imagine we'll be in this fight for a while, and we'll stand by each other."

World News: Iraqi Forces Move to Retake Western Mosul --- Civilians urged to flee as ground offensive advances against Islamic State

Iraqi security forces launched a ground offensive early Sunday to retake the western side of Mosul from Islamic State, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said, breaking a weekslong stall in the battle for the city.

The fight for areas of Mosul west of the Tigris river began with a push toward its main airport and is being led by federal police forces, with Iraq's army and militias also involved in the effort, Iraqi military officials said. Hours before the operation began, Iraqi air forces dropped millions of leaflets on the west side of the city urging civilians to flee.

"It's your last chance to drop weapons, to quit Daesh, since Daesh is a stranger in our country and our moderate religion," they read, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

"A new dawn has emerged, the dawn of the big victory," Mr. Abadi said, appearing on state television from Baghdad just after sunrise to announce the operation.

By midmorning, Iraqi military officials said they had retaken the first village on the push north to the airport.

Mosul is Iraq's second-largest city and Islamic State's major remaining stronghold in the country.

Iraq's military and allied forces first launched their offensive to wrest Mosul back in October, quickly pushing into its outer eastern neighborhoods before getting bogged down in street fighting with entrenched militants.

Operations against the extremists stalled after Iraqi security forces suffered substantial casualties. Five bridges spanning the Tigris were also damaged or destroyed by fighting, leaving the forces no way to cross over to west Mosul and continue the operation.

Iraq's military and U.S.-trained special forces units have battled Islamic State with the help of U.S.-led coalition air support and advisers, including special operations forces, on the ground.

"Mosul would be a tough fight for any army in the world, and the Iraqi forces have risen to the challenge," said Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top American commander in Iraq, after the operation's relaunch. "They have taken the fight to the enemy and sacrificed their blood for the people of Iraq and the rest of the world."

U.S. forces are playing the same supporting role they played in east Mosul, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Sunday in Abu Dhabi.

"We will continue with the accelerated effort to destroy ISIS," he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

At any point in the past few days there have been as many as 50 aircraft over Mosul, U.S. military officials said, striking Islamic State headquarters buildings and police stations, among other targets.

But the fight on the west side of the city could prove an even greater military and political challenge.

The western neighborhood of Old Mosul, with dense warrens of narrow streets, will likely be the scene of guerrilla-style fighting. The urban warfare could be especially deadly for regular Iraqi army troops, who don't have the same training and equipment as the special forces.

The U.S. military operating over Mosul is finding it harder to conduct airstrikes due to the density of buildings and people, the U.S. military officers said. The military is required to have few if any civilian casualties.

The city's western outskirts are also now surrounded by Iraqi forces, leaving Islamic State fighters no escape route and giving them few options but to dig in for a long fight.

Battle for Mosul Resumes, Says Iraqi Prime Minister; Security forces launch ground offensive to retake western side of the city

"A new dawn has emerged, the dawn of the big victory," Mr. Abadi said, appearing on state television from Baghdad just after sunrise to announce the operation. "Liberate what is left of this city and liberate people from aggression and the terrorism of [Islamic State] and get rid of it forever."

By midmorning, Iraqi military officials said they had retaken the first village on the push north to the airport.

Mosul is Iraq's second-largest city and Islamic State's major remaining stronghold in the country.

The city's western outskirts are also now surrounded by Iraqi forces, leaving Islamic State fighters no escape route and giving them few options but to dig in for a long fight.

Gen. Townsend said earlier in February that he expects Islamic State to be pushed out of Mosul within six months.

Attention will then turn to the restoration of Mosul.

The police force in Mosul is understaffed and undertrained, leaving the gaps to be filled by hastily trained militiamen.

As displaced residents of east Mosul begin to stream home, checkpoints are clogged and infrastructure is strained, much of it having been damaged in the fighting.

Some 160,000 people remained displaced from the Mosul area, according to recent United Nations estimates.

Thousands More Troops Needed in Afghanistan, Top U.S. Commander Tells Senate Panel; Army Gen. John Nicholson also said Russia's meddling complicating fight against counterterrorism

WASHINGTON— few thousand more troops are needed to help end the stalemate in Afghanistan, according to a senior U.S. military commander who also told lawmakers that Russian meddling was complicating the counterterrorism fight.

Army Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, didn't provide the Senate Armed Services Committee with an exact number of additional forces. However, he said Thursday they could come from the U.S. or other countries in the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan, where the war is now in its 16th year.

He said they were necessary to properly train and advise the Afghan military and perform work now handled at greater cost by contractors. There are currently about 8,400 U.S. troops conducting counterterrorism operations against insurgents and training the Afghan army.

Gen. Nicholson said he had discussed troop levels with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Nicholson said he believes the Trump administration will be open to a level based on requirements, rather than a predetermined figure. Republicans criticized former President Barack Obama for trying, in their view, to cut the number too sharply before he left office Jan. 20.

Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), the committee chairman, said after the hearing he would back Nicholson's request and called the boost a "penalty" to be paid for former President Barack Obama's refusal to commit enough forces. "When the general says we're not winning? And the Russians are increasing their influence? And al Qaeda is increasing? We really have no choice," Sen. McCain told reporters.

But the idea of sending more Americans to the war zone might not go over well with a public frustrated by the length and cost of the conflict. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), citing figures from the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said the war was costing U.S. taxpayers $13 million a day.

Gen. Nicholson also disclosed that a U.S. Special Forces soldier was "severely wounded" in fighting Thursday in Sangin, the Taliban heartland in southern Afghanistan. He gave an example of how additional forces would be used. Gen. Nicholson said that because of troop level limits, the aviation brigade that deployed to Afghanistan was able to bring its helicopters, pilots and staff, but had to leave its mechanics behind at Fort Riley in Kansas.

Contractors were hired instead at a cost of "tens of millions of dollars," forcing the soldier mechanics to sit at home, Gen. Nicholson said, and affecting the Army unit's readiness. He said there was a 2-1 ratio of contractors to troops in Afghanistan.

In response to a question from Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.), Gen. Nicholson said he didn't have enough troops to provide proper oversight of all those contractors.

Gen. Nicholson contended that Russia had been publicly legitimizing the Taliban by claiming that the militants were fighting Islamic terrorists while the Afghan government wasn't. He called that a "false narrative" and argued that Moscow's goal was to undermine the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Afghanistan.

Afghan security forces have reduced by one-half the number of Islamic State fighters and by two-thirds the amount of territory the extremists hold, according to the commander.

He declined to say in the open hearing whether Russia was providing support for the Taliban and in what way. Afterward, Gen. Nicholson told the Associated Press he was referring to classified intelligence. He wouldn't discuss the matter further.

The Russians recently invited representatives from the Taliban, as well as from China, Pakistan and other countries in the region, to Moscow for meetings about Afghanistan's future, but didn't include officials from the Kabul government, Gen. Nicholson said.

"A peace and reconciliation process should be Afghan-led," the general said.

Despite Moscow's overtures, Gen. Nicholson said many Afghans don't view Russia favorably, dating to the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.

Several Republican senators Thursday urged President Donald Trump to pursue a "tough-minded and principled policy toward" Russia. They want Mr. Trump to maintain current U.S. sanctions against Russia, rebuke Moscow for its continued aggression in Ukraine, and not enter into any military or diplomatic agreement with Russia on Syria's future until Moscow ends its "support for the murderous regime" of President Bashar al-Assad.

Gen. Nicholson described the security situation in Afghanistan as a "stalemate."

"Can we win?" asked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.). Yes, Gen. Nicholson said. He described victory as a stable, centralized Afghan government and destruction of al Qaeda and Islamic State. Leaving before then means it is "just a matter of time" before terrorists launch another attack on the U.S. from havens in Afghanistan, he said.

ALABAMA

Successor Named to

Sessions Senate Seat

Alabama's governor appointed Luther Strange, a Republican and the state's attorney general, to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, who is the nation's new attorney general.

Mr. Strange was expected to be sworn in to the Senate on Thursday afternoon. His term will extend until the next Alabama senator is chosen in a special election in 2018.

Mr. Strange's appointment won't change the balance of power in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 majority. But GOP leaders need to have him quickly installed, because they are still voting on many of President Donald Trump's cabinet nominees and can afford few GOP defections.

Yemen Seeks Tighter Coordination After U.S. Raid; But officials denied a report that they had withdrawn permission for such operations

Yemeni officials pushed for stronger counterterror cooperation with the U.S. after an American commando raid last month on an al Qaeda stronghold in Yemen resulted in casualties, but denied a report that they had revoked permission to conduct such raids.

Ahmed Bin Mubarak, Yemen's ambassador to Washington, said Wednesday his government hadn't withdrawn permission for the U.S. to carry out ground missions but had "made clear our reservations about the last operation."

"We said that in the future there needs to be more coordination with Yemeni authorities before any operation and that there needs to be consideration for our sovereignty," he added. "We are a partner with the United States in fighting terrorism."

Yemen's foreign minister, Abdul-Malik al-Mekhlafi, told the Associated Press that reports that Yemen has demanded a halt to U.S. special operations are "not true."

Two other officials in the internationally recognized government of Yemen's President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi said they were looking for closer coordination with the U.S. rather than a suspension of raids.

The New York Times had earlier reported that Yemen withdrew permission for the U.S. to conduct raids on its soil, citing American officials.

"We stand by the story," said Eileen Murphy, a New York Times spokeswoman.

The White House wouldn't say Wednesday whether the U.S. had been asked to halt operations, saying it is working with Yemen "through diplomatic channels."

"Yemen more than most countries fully appreciates the fight that we have against ISIS," White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said.

Officials with the military's U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces across the Middle East, said they have received no request to halt operations. "We haven't been told or been ordered from the Pentagon to stop any planning or operations that we have at this time," said Maj. Josh Jacques, a spokesman.

Pentagon officials referred questions to the State Department. Mark Toner, the State Department spokesman, said he was aware of the reports about the suspension and Yemen's denial of those reports.

"The United States conducts operations consistent with international law and in coordination with the government of Yemen," he said.

One American Navy SEAL and at least two dozen Yemenis were killed during a U.S. special operations forces raid on Jan. 29 in the remote village of Yakla in Yemen's al-Bayda province, according to residents and Yemeni officials.

Among the dead were senior leaders of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror group's potent Yemeni offshoot, according to residents, the U.S. military and AQAP leader Qasim al-Raymi, who urged retaliation after the raid.

It was the first such operation authorized under President Donald Trump, who put counterterrorism near the top of his agenda after taking office in January. Despite the Navy SEAL's death and the U.S. military's conclusion that civilians were likely killed in the operation, the Trump administration has defended the operation and called it a success.

The U.S. is continuing to carry out operations against AQAP in Yemen, including drone strikes, amid the country's political turbulence.

Mr. Hadi has been fighting a war for almost two years against the country's Shiite Muslim Houthi rebels, who control the capital, San'a. He is backed by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, the region's leading Sunni Muslim power.

AQAP and other Sunni extremists oppose the Houthis, but have also carried out attacks targeting Mr. Hadi's government.

Arizona Man Sentenced for Planning Islamic State-Inspired Attack in Texas; Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem faces 30 years in prison for his role in attack on cartoon-drawing contest

A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced a Phoenix man to 30 years in prison for helping to plan an Islamic-State inspired attack in Texas, a case that resulted in the first conviction of its kind won by the Justice Department.

Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, 45 years old, was found guilty last March of five charges related to his role in plotting an attack by two gunmen on a 2015 event in Garland, Texas, that featured a cartoon-drawing contest of the Prophet Muhammad. Both gunmen were killed in the attack, which wounded a security guard, and the Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the attack.

Mr. Kareem's trial had been a test case for the government as it was only the second time that a U.S. jury had decided the outcome of an Islamic State-related case.

Last year, federal prosecutors won their first trial conviction of a suspected Islamic State supporter in New York, but Mr. Kareem's case was the first instance in the U.S. where someone was tried for actually participating in the plotting of an Islamic State-inspired attack.

"Today's sentence, in the country's first trial involving a homeland terrorist attack committed in the name of ISIL, demonstrates the commitment of the United States to hold accountable any person who participates in or aids in any way acts of terrorism against our citizens," said Acting Arizona U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange, referring to Islamic State, sometimes called ISIL or ISIS for short.

Prosecutors had asked Judge Susan Bolton to sentence Mr. Kareem to 50 years in the case. A lawyer for Mr. Kareem, who pleaded not guilty, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

At Mr. Kareem's trial, prosecutors sought to portray the moving-company owner as the mastermind behind the Texas attack, saying he had persuaded the two gunmen, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, to carry it out. Both men were friends of his, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors also said Mr. Kareem provided the two men with guns and ammunition for the cartoon-contest attack and taught them how to shoot. The men also discussed attacking the Super Bowl, which was held in Glendale, Ariz., in 2015, prosecutors said.

Mr. Kareem denied the allegations, taking the stand to testify that he had no knowledge of the attack before it happened. Mr. Kareem's defense lawyer said Mr. Kareem had been unjustly targeted simply because he was friends with the two gunmen.

A federal jury found him guilty of conspiring to provide material support to Islamic State, interstate transportation of firearms with the intent to commit murder and other charges.

Of the 114 individuals charged with ISIS related activities in the U.S. since March 2014, 65 have plead or been found guilty, according to Seamus Hughes, Deputy Director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Only a small number of those case—t least a half dozen—ave gone to a jury, Mr. Hughes said.

A Day in the Life of Karen Elson; Far from the fashion world, the singer-songwriter and model is right at home in Nashville

I WANT TO LOOK like a Christmas tree," says Karen Elson, 38, as she pores over dresses in her airy walk-in closet. The model, singer-songwriter and mother of two is at home in Nashville, on a cloudy December afternoon, in search of an outfit for the evening. In four hours, she will arrive at the city's historic Ryman Auditorium to take part in the ensemble holiday performance Nashville Noel Nights, joining bandleaders Rufus and Martha Wainwright and country music legends Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss. Elson will sing Johnny Cash's "Ringing the Bells for Jim"— chance to stretch her stage legs as she prepares to release her sophomore album, Double Roses, in April. "You can't hide," says Elson of performing at the Ryman. "It's kind of terrifying."

Yet an inability to hide has been one of the defining features of Elson's life. Raised in Manchester, England, the singer endured endless teasing from schoolmates and was known for her red hair and pale skin—he title of her 2010 debut record, The Ghost Who Walks, was one of her childhood nicknames. The fashion world, however, embraced her wan, bewitching look, affording her a high-flying modeling career that has seen her appear on the covers of Vogue and Elle; walk runways for Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen; and serve as the global ambassador for major brands—he was recently named the newest face of Jo Malone London. Despite her success, she began quietly pursuing other interests, namely singing and songwriting, first finding an outlet for her talent with the Citizens Band, a New York cabaret troupe she helped found. In 2005, she married the musician Jack White, of the rock duo the White Stripes; the couple, who divorced in 2013, recorded The Ghost Who Walks, a collection of dusty folk tunes and bluesy ballads, in White's studio.

Elson's latest outing, inspired by a Sam Shepard poem, is slower, more introspective, infused with a longing that recalls Stevie Nicks. When she steps onstage in Nashville to sing in a radiant red Gucci dress, she doesn't much resemble a Christmas tree, but an English rose readily comes to mind.

Elson By the Numbers

The Thomas Hobbes Presidency; Conservatives were outraged by Obama's apologies. What about Trump's slander?

First, the obvious: Had it been Barack Obama, rather than Donald Trump, who suggested a moral equivalency between the United States and Vladimir Putin's Russia, Republican politicians would not now be rushing through their objections to the comparison in TV interviews while hoping to pivot to tax reform.

Had it been the president of three weeks ago who had answered Bill O'Reilly's comment that Mr. Putin "is a killer" by saying, "We've got a lot of killers," and "What do you think? Our country's so innocent?" conservative pundits wouldn't rest with calling the remark "inexplicable" or "troubling." They would call it moral treason and spend the next four years playing the same clip on repeat, right through the next election.

In 2009, Mr. Obama gave a series of speeches containing passing expressions of regret for vaguely specified blemishes from the American past. Examples: "The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in history." And "we've made some mistakes." This was the so-called Apology Tour, in which the word "apologize" was never uttered. Even so, conservatives still fume about it.

This time, Mr. Trump didn't apologize for America. He indicted it. He did so in language unprecedented for any sitting or former president. He did it in a manner guaranteed, and perhaps calculated, to vindicate every hard-left slander of "Amerika." If you are the sort who believes the CIA assassinated JFK, masterminded the crack-cocaine epidemic, and deliberately lied us into the war in Iraq—onspiracy theories on a moral par with the way the Putin regime behaves in actual fact—hen this president is for you.

Only he's worse.

For the most part, the left's various indictments of the U.S., whether well- or ill-grounded, have had a moral purpose: to shame Americans into better behavior. We are reminded of the evils of slavery and Jim Crow in order not to be racist. We dilate on the failure in Vietnam to guard against the arrogance of power. We recall the abuses of McCarthyism in order to underscore the importance of civil liberties.

Mr. Trump's purpose, by contrast, isn't to prevent a recurrence of bad behavior. It's to permit it. In this reading, Mr. Putin's behavior isn't so different from ours. It's largely the same, except more honest and effective. The U.S. could surely defeat ISIS—f only it weren't hampered by the kind of scruples that keep us from carpet bombing Mosul in the way the Russians obliterated Aleppo. The U.S. could have come out ahead in Iraq—f only we'd behaved like unapologetic conquerors, not do-gooder liberators, and taken their oil.

This also explains why Mr. Trump doesn't believe in American exceptionalism, calling the idea "insulting [to] the world" and seeing it as an undue burden on our rights and opportunities as a nation. Magnanimity, fair dealing, example setting, win-win solutions, a city set upon a hill: All this, in the president's mind, is a sucker's game, obscuring the dog-eat-dog realities of life. Among other distinctions, Mr. Trump may be our first Hobbesian president.

It would be a mistake to underestimate the political potency of this outlook, with its left-right mix of relativism and jingoism. If we're no better than anyone else, why not act like everyone else? If phrases such as "the free world" or the "liberal international order" are ideological ploys by which the Davos elite swindle the proletarians of Detroit, why sacrifice blood and treasure on their behalf? Nationalism is usually a form of moral earnestness. Mr. Trump's genius has been to transform it into an expression of cynicism.

That cynicism won't be easy to defeat. Right now, a courageous Russian opposition activist named Vladimir Kara-Murza is fighting for his life in a Moscow hospital, having been poisoned for a second time by you-can-easily-guess-who. Assuming Mr. Trump is even aware of the case, would he be wrong in betting that most Americans are as indifferent to his fate as he is?

The larger question for conservatives is how Mr. Trump's dim view of the world will serve them over time. Honorable Republicans such as Nebraska's Sen. Ben Sasse have been unequivocal in their outrage, which will surely cost them politically. Others have hit the mute button, on the theory that it's foolish to be baited by the president's every crass utterance. The risk is that silence quickly becomes a form of acquiescence. Besides, since when did conservatives reared to their convictions by the rhetoric of Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan hold words so cheap?

Speaking of Reagan, Feb. 6 would have been his 106th birthday. Perhaps because he had been an actor, the 40th president knew that Americans preferred stories in which good guys triumphed over bad ones, not the ones in which they were pretty much all alike. Conservatives should beware the president's invitation to a political film noir in which the outcome is invariably bleak.

U.S. News: Republican Visa Bill Led to List of Nations in Travel Ban

White House officials had an answer ready when reporters asked how President Donald Trump chose the seven countries whose citizens he temporarily banned from entering the U.S.: He took his cues from the Obama administration.

President Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said in a recent appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the places named in Mr. Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees were "identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists and affirmed by Congress."

Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump's press secretary, repeated the claim during a news conference a week ago.

But most of the countries were first identified in legislation introduced by Republicans. The bill, which later passed Congress with bipartisan support, was aimed not at curbing immigration, but atpressuring European allies to share more terror-related intelligence.

The bill was signed by President Barack Obama in 2015. His Department of Homeland Security later added three more countries to the list, using criteria established by the new law.

A spokesman for the Trump White House said Mr. Obama "designated four of the countries when he signed the law and the other three" later on.

The story of how the seven majority-Muslim countries came to be in Mr. Trump's order begins with a 2014 bill introduced by then-Rep. Candice Miller, a Michigan Republican who retired from Congress this year. The bill sought to tighten the security of a U.S. program that allows citizens of the U.K., France and three dozen other nations to travel to the U.S. without a visa.

Reports of young Europeans streaming onto battlefields in Iraq and Syria to fight for ISIS or other terrorist organizations alarmed lawmakers, who worried returning fighters could exploit the visa-waiver program to travel undetected to the U.S., according to congressional aides.

Members of the House Homeland Security Committee were concerned countries participating in the visa-waiver program were withholding "vital terrorism data" from the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Intelligence community, according to a committee report on the bill.

Ms. Miller's bill forced countries to turn over intelligence about their citizens with suspected terrorist links or face suspension from the program, which allows eligible foreigners to travel to the U.S. after filling out an online questionnaire.

She introduced an amended version of the bill, which became the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act, the following year. Citizens from the 38 countries in the program who had made trips to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria since 2011 would be ineligible to enter the U.S. without a visa.

The law didn't affect the travel of citizens from those seven nations to the U.S. They could still obtain a visa, until Jan. 27 when Mr. Trump signed his order.

Trump's SCOTUS Nominee; A transcript of the weekend's program on FOX News Channel.

Judge Neil Gorsuch : I pledge that if I'm confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country. It is the rule of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge--stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.

Paul Gigot: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm Paul Gigot.

President Donald Trump unveiled his pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court this week, nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the tenth circuit court of appeals. Democrats wasting no time declaring their opposition in advancing the notion of a stolen Supreme Court seat.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Let's not mince words. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch is a huge gift to the giant corporations and wealthy individuals who have stolen a Supreme Court seat in order to make sure that the justice system works for them.

Gigot: Joining the panel this week, "Wall Street Journal" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; editorial board member, Colin Levy; editorial features editor, James Taranto; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.

So, Colin, I'm going to let our viewers or in on a secret -- you really wanted Judge Gorsuch to be the pick.

Why do you think his reception has been so good across the conservative Republican spectrum?

Colin Levy: Yeah. He really threads the needle. He's got something that conservatives all like. You know, he has over 200 published opinions, so that's a long, long record that conservatives can look at and know that he is someone who's going to interpret the Constitution based on its original meaning. But he's also got credentials to show that he's really right in the legal mainstream. He's had about eight opinions go up to the Supreme Court. Of those, seven were upheld. So, for Democrats to come out and say, you know, he's kind of a wacky guy out on the right somewhere, it just doesn't hold water.

Gigot: And a couple of good opinions on religious liberty in particular, right, Colin?

Levy: Yes. He has great opinions on religious liberty. He also has great opinions on limiting the power of the administrative state. Those are things conservatives are very interested in because they get right to the power of the federal government.

Gigot: Right.

And that point about the administrative state, Kim, is that he's -- there's a doctrine in the Supreme Court that regulator -- judges should show deference to regulators if the statute is ambiguous. There's a movement now, and Gorsuch is part of it, that says, you know what, regulators are taking advantage of that to rewrite laws without legislative permission.

Kim Strassel: Yeah. This is known as the Chevron Deference. In one wonderful opinion that Judge Gorsuch wrote, he pointed out that allowing the very people who actually administer the law to also interpret it and say how it works is hugely problematic, and that this is, indeed, why we have courts and, therefore, we should be more skeptical of this sort of deference. That will cheer a lot of conservatives as well, too.

Gigot: Yeah, that's interesting.

What about the process that was followed here, James, by Donald Trump? Tell us about the role of Leonard Leo in the Federalist Society.

James Taranto: Well, Leonard Leo, who runs the Federalist Society, as I understand it, Mr. Trump, as a candidate, came to Leonard and said would you give me a list, would you tell me who I should nominate. And Leonard came up with a list of about half a dozen names --

Gigot: It was first eight.

Taranto: First eight. And he said, is that all you got?

In the end, there were two lists, and I think it was 21, 32 --

Gigot: It was 21.

Taranto: Gorsuch made it on the second list, because, a Leonard said, they looked at Gorsuch's record and they were more impressed the more they read.

Gigot: The interesting thing here, Dan, is that Trump understood there'd be skepticism about him and his relatively recent, let's say, conversion to conservative judicial principles. So, he said I want that list, because this is going to show who -- this is going to show I'm serious, this is going to show I'm sincere. And he followed through by picking somebody from the list. Shrewd. And I think Trump recognizes that the court is one of the reasons that he won the election.

Dan Henninger: Yeah. Well, Paul, it almost sounds like a model for Trump decision making, doesn't it?

We can hope.

Gigot: Yeah.

Henninger: Because they have a path forward. They're taking him around to the Senate now, introducing him.

And as Colin said, this is an individual that has threaded the needle, you know? On executive authority, much less deferential than either Antonin Scalia or Merrick Garland, Barack Obama's pick. Much less deferential to, say, prosecutorial authority than Merrick Garland was.

What Gorsuch emphasizes is the freedom of the individual. Individual liberty against the government, against the state. And then he says I want to read into the textual -- what the text of the laws say or what the Constitution says. So, he is a judge who's very hard to oppose from the right or left unless you believe in judge-made law.

Gigot: What about this idea, Colin, of a stolen election that Elizabeth Warren offered up? First of all, it's funny, she said let's not mince words. I don't know that Elizabeth Warren has ever minced words.

What about the idea of a stolen Supreme Court seat?

Levy: Right, Paul. That's completely a myth. The whole idea that Republicans stole this seat by opposing Merrick Garland's nomination, not giving him a hearing, is an idea that was actually previously floated by Democrats. In 2007, Chuck Schumer said we shouldn't have hearings on any of Bush's nominees. Back in 1992, Joe Biden said, you know, if there are any nominees that come up in the last year of this presidency, we shouldn't hear them. If the president puts them forward, we should basically ignore it.

So, the idea that Democrats would have done anything different than Republicans did, other than let the people have a say and go forward from there, is just, I mean, it's sort of silly.

Gigot: Let's hear what Chuck Schumer had to say, the Senate minority leader.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: We Democrats will insist on a rigorous but fair process. There will be 60 votes for confirmation. Any one member can require it. Many Democrats already have. And it is the right thing to do.

Gigot: James, the 60-vote standard, is that him hinting at a filibuster or just trying to -- but not committing to it?

Taranto: Yeah. And the reason he's not committing to it is because the Republicans have the majority. If the Republicans stick together, they could, as the Democrats did under Harry Reid in 2013, exercise what's called the nuclear option, which the Democrats left only for Supreme Court seats. I think both sides are reluctant to commit on that because Mitch McConnell isn't sure he can get all of his members together so he wants to wait until there's a real provocation. But I don't think Schumer is convinced he can uphold the filibuster either.

Gigot: And, Kim, what do you think about the Democrats? It sounded to me like Schumer really doesn't want to do the filibuster if he doesn't have to, and there are about 10 Democrats who got elected in -- who are running in 2018 in states Trump won, and they're going to have a hard decision to make.

Strassel: Yeah. Five of them, in particular, in states that Trump just ran away with the election in their states, and that would be places like Montana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Indiana, but another five from swing states where Trump won. If the Democrats lose eight people who decide that they want to go ahead with an up-and-down vote, that's all the Republicans need to go forward. And there is some talk in the Democratic caucus about letting this one go because this is, in fact, a replacement for a conservative justice, Antonin Scalia, and that maybe if they're going to go down this road of a big filibuster, they should save it in case Trump gets another potential to nominate another judge --

Gigot: Right.

Strassel: -- which might be far more controversial --

Henninger: But, you know --

Strassel: -- and truly change the court.

Gigot: All right, Dan.

Henninger: Progressive activists are putting tremendous pressure on the Democrats to oppose Gorsuch. Demonstrations in front of Chuck Schumer's residence in Brooklyn twice this week.

Gigot: That's fun.

All right, Dan, thank you.

When we come back, as the Trump administration gears up for a Supreme Court fight, we'll ask Judiciary Committee member, Lindsey Graham, how he thinks Neil Gorsuch will fare in the Senate.

President Donald Trump: If we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington for the last -- longer than eight years, in all fairness to President Obama, a lot longer than eight years -- but if we end up with that gridlock, I would say, if you can, Mitch, go nuclear. Because that would be an absolute shame, if a man of this quality was caught up in the web.

Gigot: President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, made the rounds on Capitol Hill this week as the White House prepares for a confirmation fight with Democrats. President Trump urging Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to go nuclear if necessary and abandon the 60-vote threshold for confirmation.

I spoke to South Carolina Senator and Judiciary Committee member, Lindsey Graham, earlier this week, and asked him how he thinks Gorsuch will fare in the Senate.

Sen. Lindsey Graham: He's going to get approved. I could not think of a better pick if I were president myself. I think any Republican president would put him on top of their list. Outstanding choice, well qualified. Should be confirmed and, hopefully, without having to change the rules.

Gigot: OK. You were part of, a decade ago, a group of 14 Senators --

Graham: Yeah.

Gigot: -- who tried to prevent a filibuster and approve judicial nominees. Now if -

Graham: Right.

Gigot: -- and there's a lot of talk among the Democrats about a filibuster, would you be prepared to vote to break one?

Graham: I don't think I'm going to have to do that, but I will do whatever's necessary to make sure this president is able to the choose a qualified nominee, and Neil Gorsuch is beyond qualified. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan, not because I would have chosen them, because I thought they were qualified. The gang of 14 agreement said you should reserve filibusters unless there's an extraordinary circumstance.

Gigot: Right.

Graham: There's nothing extraordinary about this other than his qualifications.

Gigot: So you don't expect the Democrats to filibuster?

Graham: No, I think it'd be dumb politically. There's at least 10 Democrats in Trump states that would look like, not only did you lose the election, you lost your mind.

How can anybody say this man is not as qualified as much as Sotomayor and Kagan?

Schumer's got to tell the left to knock it off. Mitch McConnell kind of tamped the right down when we shut down the government to repeal Obamacare when Obama was still president. That was kind of crazy. What they're doing is crazy and, hopefully, they'll become more sane.

Gigot: It's -- would you extend this crazy word to the opposition you're seeing to really across the board right now to the president's cabinet nominees? I mean, you know --

Graham: Yeah.

Gigot: -- they're voting against them, not showing up for hearings. What's going on?

Graham: I think they're making the Republican Party more viable by the day. This is what's wrong with Washington. Trump won. I didn't support him. He's president. He deserves a cabinet. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan and almost all of Obama's nominees because I thought that was my job as Senator, to give the person a qualified cabinet and Supreme Court picks. What they're doing is they're acting like the election didn't happen. They're driven by their base. And I think they're going to hurt the institution and hurt themselves. And they're certainly not being fair to President Trump.

Gigot: All right. Let's turn to some policies. You've been critical of the president's refugee order.

Graham: Right.

Gigot: Now, presumably, they're going to go ahead with that anyway. They modified it a bit or at least explained it a bit better now. What's your advice going forward after the suspension period is over, just give it up and allow the refugees, allow more of them in?

Graham: No. I actually support a timeout in terms of these seven countries. There's nothing unusual about a pause on failed states in terms of future flow of refugees. My problem was you need to think about these things. The interpreter is not the problem, he's the solution. And it's being perceived as a war on the faith rather than an attempt to make America safer. So, my problem is with the way it's been rolled out.

Gigot: Now, you mean the interpreters that have helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere?

Graham: Yeah.

Gigot: They are part of this suspension. And those people, in your view, they should be allowed into the United States if we're ever going to get anybody to help us again.

Graham: I'd put them up on Mount Rushmore. We've got 8,000 soldiers in Iraq today. The way we treat these people is going to determine how we can win the war of the future.

And I've got a young lady who is a PhD graduate from Iran at Clemson, works for a start-up company, everybody loves her. Her name is Naz (ph). She got taken off a plane in Dubai. She had a legal visa. So, I think General Kelly will eventually get this right. You've got to give people who have a legal status a chance to make their case while they're still legal. You can't ban them if they've been given a visa. You can ask them more questions. Green card holders, you can't ban them but you can ask them more questions. Then maybe you can ban them if they're done something wrong. But It should be prospectively applied.

Gigot: How do you -- you were critical of President Trump, then-Candidate Trump. I think I remember that.

What do you --

Graham: You were the one listening.

Gigot: What do you think about his - about how he's handling foreign policy here in the first bit of his administration?

Graham: Pretty good. Rebuilding the military, check. Count me in. You're not going to be strong if you're weak militarily. So, he wants to rebuild the military.

On Russia, he scares the hell out of me. I hope he doesn't buy a deal in Syria that would put Damascus to Assad and the Iranians and put Russia in a prime spot --

Gigot: What about --

Graham: So the Russia problem bothers me.

Gigot: What about the spats with Mexico, canceling the trip, and now you get one with the Australian prime minister, the phone conversation leaked where they were apparently clashing over taking 1250 refugees off Australia's hands? That's not a good look for allies, is it?

Graham: No. I mean, you know, my dad served with an Australian unit in New Guinea in World War II. These are some of our best friends in the world. But a phone call's not going to break this relationship.

Gigot: OK.

Graham: He's off key. But here's what I want him to get right. I don't want him to do what Obama did, misjudge the Russians, misjudge the Iranians. Any deal that gives Damascus to Assad is never going to end the Syrian civil war, and it's going to help al-Qaeda and ISIL.

Gigot: Right.

OK, now on Russia, Vladimir Putin ramping up the military operation in Ukraine right now, here at the onset of the Trump administration. How do you read the timing of this?

Graham: I think Iran is testing Trump by test-firing the missiles and saying we're going to continue to do so. Russia is testing Trump. They're engaging on one hand, and trying to push forward in even Ukraine on the other. So, here's what I'm going to do in a bipartisan fashion. I'm going to introduce new sanctions on Russia for their interference in our election that go beyond what we have done for their seizing of the Crimea. It is not enough to punish them for what they did in the Ukraine. We have to also punish them for what they did in our own backyard. and I hope President Trump will embrace that.

Gigot: We're going to be watching to see if he does.

Thank you for being here, Senator Graham.

Graham: Thank you.

Gigot: Since that interview, the Trump administration has said it will amend its visa ban to allow Iraqi interpreters and their families into the United States.

When we come back, as the fallout continues from President Trump's executive order on immigration, our panel looks at what went wrong with the rollout and how the administration can get back on track.

Gigot: Continuing fallout this week from President Trump's executive order on immigration as protests continued in cities across the country. The White House fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates Monday night for refusing to defend the controversial order, saying she had "betrayed" the Department of Justice.

We're back with Dan Henninger, James Taranto and Kim Strassel.

So, Dan, I'm going to suggest that we went from the best moment so far of the Trump presidency, the Supreme Court rollout, to what I think has been the worst, which is this immigration rollout. What happened on the immigration order?

Henninger: Well, it looks as though what happened, Paul, is that a policy that was known as extreme vetting wasn't thoroughly vetted itself, and it rolled out, and immediately up to three or four federal judges that weekend found holes in the order and issued stays. Not only that, but a lot of people didn't know what was coming. Obviously, much of the bureaucracy didn't know it was coming. Silicon Valley, which hires a lot of immigrants on visas coming into the United States, they didn't know this was coming. And so, it wasn't merely the people in the streets and at the airports marching. We know about them. They're always in the streets these days.

But they put in motion so many other forces out there against this order which came to be known as an Islamic ban, a Muslim ban, and the administration was really put on its back foot. They're still on their back foot. Now they have to come forth with a real policy that implements this order. And this just sort of showed a lack of preparation that made them unnecessarily under attack.

Gigot: James, we know it was a very close hold on the White House. Steve Bannon and Steve Miller, two senior aides, very influential, kind of ran this operation. They didn't brief a lot of people. They said, oh, it might leak. It wasn't thoroughly vetted. It wasn't thoroughly informed by the Border Patrol, even the customs people, so you had confusion. Green holders, for example, were they under it, who were dual citizens, and were interpreters? It was a lot of confusion.

Taranto: Yeah. And be there's some confusion about the confusion in that, for example, we heard that the Homeland Security secretary wasn't briefed, but then he said he was. So, it's -- it's all very confusing --

Gigot: Briefed, but how much was he consulted?

Taranto: Right. I don't think we quite know. And it's hard to argue this was anything other than the fiasco in terms of its administration.

Gigot: What about the substance? Do you think you can defend the substance?

Taranto: Well, I think the basic premise that a country has the right to decide whom to let in and under what circumstances is very defensible, and it is under attack by a lot of protesters. People say, you know, we're a nation of immigrants, this goes against that. Of course, it doesn't.

The specific substance, I think there's a lot to criticize --

Gigot: Too sweeping? Too sweeping, the ban?

Taranto: Perhaps too sweeps and not sweeping enough in other ways because it leaves out countries --

Gigot: Like Pakistan --

Taranto: Saudi Arabia and so forth.

Gigot: And Saudi Arabia.

Taranto: The countries that were chosen, by the way, were chosen on a, I think, politically smart basis. This was based on a law that was passed in 2015 and then additions were made by the Obama administration.

Gigot: OK. Kim, what have we learned, what have you learned about the way the Trump administration makes decisions from this -- this episode?

Strassel: Well, it is a very close hold. You seem to have a group of very key advisers, folks like Steve Bannon, Steve Miller, who are around the president. Now, I would stress that from everything I understand, it is Donald Trump who makes the final call, so it's important not to suggest he's being run by a lot of people --

Gigot: Sure.

Strassel: -- in the White House.

Gigot: Sure.

Strassel: But this is a very small team. You can tell, by the way, not a lot of leaks out of this White House. Things come, and when they come, they are news. But not a lot of vetting, as a result, and not a lot of input from other agencies, which is typically and traditionally the way things happen in White Houses. They come up with an idea, they send it out to get everybody's thoughts, and it comes back. It's why White Houses traditionally move slowly. And that's not the imperative here for this White House. They want to move quickly, but you're going to have fiascoes like this when you do.

Gigot: Kim, did President Trump have any choice other than to fire Sally Yates as acting attorney general?

Strassel: None whatsoever. And it was the absolute correct call. When you are the attorney general, your client is the president of the United States, and to enforce what they have put out there. Now, in very rare circumstances you can potentially make the case for why you wouldn't enforce a law or a directive, but the standard for that is, is it unconstitutional. That was not the standard she used. She said she didn't think this order was moral or just. She doesn't get to impose her own will on the law.

Gigot: I guess one point I'd make, Dan, is a lot of corporate America here this week really didn't know what was going on.

Henninger: No.

Gigot: And, I mean, we discussed it at our own executive meeting. Who's covered, who isn't? Do people have to leave the country, stay in the country if they're waiting for a green card? You just don't want this to happen if you're running a government.

Henninger: No, you don't. And now General Kelly and Homeland Security are going to quickly have to put some meat into the idea of extreme vetting. Either you want to make a policy or do it through court litigation.

There was a policy put in place by the Border Patrol under the Obama administration which asked people to voluntarily come into the country and fill out their user name, their websites visited and social media. That is the sort of thing General Kelly has in mind to do immediately.

Gigot: All right.

Still ahead, Senate Republicans move aggressively to push through President Trump's cabinet nominees despite a boycott this week by Democrats. We'll look at the escalating showdown on Capitol Hill.

Unidentified man: A play that is being called by Chuck Schumer. I think it's a mistake. But it's in an effort to try to obstruct Donald Trump from getting a cabinet in place.

Gigot: Democratic opposition to Donald Trump reached new heights on Capitol Hill this week with Democrats boycotting no fewer than three of the president's cabinet nominees, leading Republicans to push them out of committee and onto the Senate floor without a single Democratic vote.

We're back with Dan Henninger, James Taranto and Kim Strassel.

So, James, what have we learned here in two weeks about the Democratic strategy of dealing with Donald Trump?

Taranto: Well, they don't have a strategy because they don't have any power, because they basically turned the Senate into a majoritarian institution in 2013 under Harry Reid with the nuclear option --

Gigot: At least regarding nominees.

Taranto: Right. And they don't have a majority.

So, let's go back to the Supreme Court, because I love this example. Many Democratic Senators are now saying we won't even meet with Gorsuch. Why? Because that's what Republicans did with Merrick Garland. But what Republican did with Merrick Garland was a cold-blooded strategic decision. They decided weaver just going to hold firm, we have a majority, 54 votes, we're not going to let anyone through while Barack Obama's still president. The Democrats don't have the power to do that. They're going to lose. And so, they're just making a show of it because their progressive supporters, the people who are camped outside Chuck Schumer's house in Brooklyn, are demanding it. But --

Gigot: So you think the boycotting is pure showmanship. It has no substance at all because they can't do anything real?

Taranto: No. It's all emotion and no strategy.

Gigot: Do you agree with that?

Henninger: Yeah, by and large. There's a question of whether it is in the interest of the Democratic Party. Progressives in the street out there yelling "Chuck grow a spine" and various chants that rhyme with Chuck --

They simply want the Democrats to fight, just like to the last man. But the Democratic Senators who are on the bubble, the 10 that are in states that Donald Trump won, do they really want them to be pushed that far left? And do they want the party to, at this point in time, sign on to a self- definition that is just basically the progressive left?

Gigot: Kim, I want to ask you about President Obama. He's still on vacation, post-presidency, well-earned. And yet, he had his spokesman issue a statement saying, basically, claiming solidarity with the members of -- with the people who are protesting in the streets, saying he's heartened by that level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. And citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organize, and have their voices heard by elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake. Why did the president get into this, at this moment, so early in Trump's term?

Strassel: You know, it's amusing, Paul. When he left, he said he was only going to weigh in at important moments. Well, this is Barack Obama, so I think we can assume we'll hear from him. In Barack Obama's mind, everything will be important. He'll talk all the time. We're not going to get the president we got with George W. Bush of respecting a successor, sitting back and letting them get on with it. Barack Obama is a young man. He might be done with elected office, but he does not view himself as done in the political movement. And he'll be out there as part of this resistance effort.

Gigot: You know, Dan, you said it may not be in the interest of the Democratic Party, but why not? Total opposition might just work. They're going to have an election in 2018. They'll say push back, push back in 2018. And if you make it difficult enough for any Democrats to cooperate with Trump on legislation, the tax reform, health care, anything else, you're going to limit his accomplishments that might have an impact of depressing Republican, so why not go all out?

Henninger: Well, I think -- I mean, there's that possibility. But, you know, most of this opposition is based in blue cities, like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley. And -- but Tim Kaine, for instance, Senator from Virginia, has voted for virtually all of Donald Trump's nominees. He wasn't affected by this.

So, I think they're isolating themselves in these redoubts, the ones that they thought they could use to win the 2016 election, and still ignoring what people think in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

Gigot: But, Kim, you suggest -- you wrote this week you didn't think the Democrats would be wise in trying to replicate or imitate the Tea Party movement. The Tea Party worked pretty well for Republicans. I mean, what am I missing here?

Strassel: Well, what you're missing is that the problem for Democrats -- when the Republicans started or when the Tea Party movement came up, it was directed at getting better quality Republicans elected, and they tended to focus a lot of their attention on already conservative districts, doing primaries against lazy incumbents and in general trying to return the party to its principles. What the left is trying to do here, the progressive movement is trying to change the party overall by frightening and challenging all of these Democrats that operate in red states, in Trump states. If they go and primary them with an Elizabeth Warren-like candidate, if you think North Dakotans are going to elect an Elizabeth Warren, that's just not going to happen. They'll end up doing damage to their own party.

Gigot: Briefly, James?

Taranto: The big problem for Democrats is they have a brutal Senate map in 2018. They're defending 25 seats, eight for Republicans, and 10 of those are states that Trump carried.

Gigot: All right, James.

Thank you all.

Still ahead, President Trump signs a two-for-one order on new regulations as Republicans in Congress move to scrap Mr. Obama-era rules. What the regulatory rollback could mean for the economy, next.

President Donald Trump: This will be the largest, ever, cut, by far, in terms of regulation. If you have a regulation you want, number one, we're not going to approve it, because it's already been approved probably in 17 different forms. But if we do, the only way you have a chance is we have to knock out two regulations for every new regulation.

Gigot: That was President Donald Trump this week surrounded by small business owners as he signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new one issued. And this comes as Republicans in Congress begin the work of repealing a flurry of so-called midnight regulations passed by the Obama administration in its final months.

We're back with Dan Henninger, Colin Levy and Kim Strassel.

So, Kim, this is a big part of the Republican/Trump economic growth strategy.

Strassel: Yeah. And one of the smartest ones. The amount that the economy suffers under the regulatory regime that we have now, this was the biggest damage that Barack Obama did to the country. You can look at the health care law and Dodd-Frank and plenty of other things that were very hard on business. But overall, it was the regulatory burden. And the way that Trump is going about doing this as well is one of the quickest and most efficient ways to make sure the regulatory regime actually does get rolled back.

Gigot: And, Colin, just the figures here, the Mercado Center did a study showing, if regulations had been frozen since 1980, the economy would be $4 trillion larger, about $13,000 per individual.

Levy: Isn't it just astonishing, Paul? I mean, actually, since 1976, there have been over 180,000 regulations written. I mean, that number is just mind-spinning. And it is the small businesses that get hit. They're the ones that either don't start up or can't expand. And it just, you know, it continues year after year. So, what Donald Trump is really doing here is disrupting fundamentally what Washington does. I mean, it's just sort of what they do, they just write more regulations. It's really good to see him trying.

Gigot: The two-for-one, Dan, rule is something of a gimmick in the sense it's going to be hard to see how you can necessarily do that. But what it will do is focus the attention of the administrative agencies and say, well, what can we -- look to see what can they repeal if they do want to issue a new regulation. So, it'll impose a discipline on regulators.

Henninger: Yeah. And it forces them to have a conversation and talk about these regulations in these terms if they're going to try to propose them.

We should make a couple of distinctions though. The order does not apply to independent agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, which Trump is going to get control of. It does mainly apply to, say, the Department of Labor, which Andy Puzder is coming in to take over, and that is one of the great sources of --

Gigot: But the Environmental Protection Agency.

Henninger: Yeah, the Environmental Protection Agency.

Gigot: Yeah, which is a huge source of problems, Kim.

Now, what's going on in the House? They and the Senate are going to use something called the Congressional Review Act, which was something that was passed under the Gingrich Congress. Most Americans probably have no idea it exists, because before this year, it had only been used once before to repeal a regulation. And what it says that if you pass a majority vote in the House and the Senate and the president signs it, you can repeal a regulation.

Strassel: Yeah. As long as it was passed within the last 60 legislative days.

Gigot: Right.

Strassel: Now, Barack Obama was quite busy with his last-minute regulations, midnight regulations as he was headed out of office. So, what you saw in the House this week was Republicans already taking aim at about six really important ones that were passed in the last 60 legislative days, voting to disapprove them, making them go away. And these are big things, like the blacklisting rule at the Labor Department, the streams rule, which was designed to shut down coal mining. There's now talk, too, turns out, one little quirk of the law, that 60-day calendar doesn't begin until legislation, there's a report filed with Congress about it. And some people are realizing that some Obama regulations never had the reports filed, so there's a potential to use the CRA and look backing to rules even from the beginning of the Obama administration.

Gigot: Do you think they're going to take advantage of that and use it? Because that means a heck of a lot more regulations would be vulnerable to repeal.

Strassel: There is swelling grassroots pressure to do this, and it certainly has come to the attention of the Trump White House. And people are looking at different ways you could go forward. Like, for instance, maybe putting out an order simply requiring all the different agency heads to look and see which rules out there did have reports filed and which didn't and might be open for a disapproval vote.

Gigot: So, Colin, you've written a lot about regulatory agencies for us, the NLRB, National Labor Relations Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Should the president fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?

Levy: Well, I mean, that certainly wouldn't do any harm, right?

Gigot: Right.

Levy: I mean, one of the things that we have to really realize here, Paul, is that not all regulations are created equal. That's something that they should also be looking at as they're reviewing them, because you have some that are really economically significant. You know, 15-20 a year that impose huge costs on the economy. And others that are just sort of sitting around on the books that no one really does much with and getting rid of them won't do as much. As they start to consider their options, I think they have to also look at the overall impact.

Gigot: All right, thank you all.

When we come back, protests erupt on the Berkeley campus forcing the cancellation of a controversial speaker. A look at the free speech movement in the age of Trump, next.

Gigot: Officials at the University of California, Berkeley, canceled the appearance of a controversial conservative speaker Wednesday night after protesters swarmed the campus, lighting fires and smashing windows. And 11 people were arrested Thursday at a New York University protest over another conservative speaker, invited to campus by college Republicans.

President Donald Trump reacted to this week's unrest in a tweet Friday saying, "Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to make America great again.

We're back with Dan Henninger, James Taranto and Kim Strassel.

So, this has been with us a while now on campus, James, this boycotting of conservative speakers. But it's getting worse. What's going on? Is this Trump?

Taranto: No, I don't think it's Trump. This has been with us at least since the 1980s, and I think it got worse during the Obama years. I think now that some of the violent reaction we've seen is of a piece with the sort of street riots we've seen in other Trump contexts. But, no, I don't think this is just Trump.

The tweet that Trump did that fascinated me was the one he did earlier in which he said, "If Berkeley can't protect its students' free speech rights" -- and then in all caps -- "no federal funds, question mark." Why not have the Department of Education investigate this and see what actually happened here and whether Berkeley fell short in protecting its students' constitutional rights?

Gigot: Well, OK. But just because you have speech discrimination, you can't ban federal funds. In other words, you can't use viewpoint discrimination to ban -- to use as a tool of federal policy.

Taranto: Well, there's certainly precedent for using federal -- withholding of federal funds to require universities to respect constitutional rights.

Let's see -- let's look into see what the law says. Maybe Congress can pass some legislation here.

Gigot: Well, I don't know that I want to go down that route myself just because of the First Amendment implications. When conservatives do that, it leads to a precedent, I think, James, that then liberals take it even further.

Taranto: Well, look, if we can get rid of the Department of Education, I'd be happy with that, too.

Gigot: Fair enough.

Henninger: You know, a lot of these universities have set up free speech zones, which means there are zones where free speech is protected. Outside those zones, you get subject to some of these college rules about hate speech and so forth, and students can get prosecuted.

There's an interesting idea out there by the Goldwater Institute and the Center for Ethics and Public Policy, which says that these public schools should commit themselves to enforcing free speech all over the campus, give people due process if they're caught up in some of these speech codes. And I think that would be a good idea. People do not appreciate the extent to which free speech is statutorily restricted on some of these public universities.

Gigot: But, you don't want to restrict -- Kim, we don't want to restrict protesters from objecting to a speech of somebody who they really dislike. I mean, this fella who was speaking at Berkeley, he doesn't represent my notion of conservative ideas. I wouldn't have shown up to listen to him. But -- so they have the right to protest themselves.

Strassel: Of course, we don't want to stop protesters. But we also don't want university administrations that, at the drop of a hat, rescind invitations or shut down events because they're giving in to the will of a bunch of whiny, coddled, adult teenagers, in essence.

So, you know, I think more of -- this is actually there's a benefit to this, Paul, because we are finally given the point we've all understood for a long time about the hostility to conservative speakers and conservative academics on campus.

Gigot: Right.

Strassel: But this is highlighting it for the entire country. And it's causing, for instance, donors who give money to universities to question what administrations are doing. Even some old-fashioned classical liberal professors on campus to worry about the lack of ideological diversity.

Gigot: And college presidents and administrators really do need to take charge here, Dan.

Henninger: Well, to the extent they can. Upon this point, they've been fairly pushed back on this.

Gigot: Cowardly?

Henninger: Cowardly.

You mentioned the Education Department, James. The thing they've been dealing with is Title IX guidance on sexual abuse, and that came with the threat of withholding federal funds.

Gigot: I don't agree with that.

Henninger: We don't agree with that. But they've become very timid to get involved in any of these kinds of controversies. And the result is the sort of thing we just saw at Berkeley.

Gigot: Quickly.

Taranto: I want to point out the mayor of Berkeley deserves a lot of the blame here. He tweeted at the beginning of the evening, "Free speech must not be used to silence marginalized voices." That is, he was egging on the rioters and claiming that the speaker was a threat to free speech. He then later put out a weak tweet saying, "Violence isn't the answer."

Gigot: Well, that's good to know.

We have to take one more break. When we come back, "Hits and Misses" of the week.

Gigot: Time now for our "Hits and Misses" of the week.

Colin, first to you.

Levy: Paul, this is a miss to protesters who launched a boycott against car company, Uber, when that company sent cars to JFK Airport during a taxi driver strike against Trump's ban on travel from Muslim countries. Uber had already come out and said that the travel ban was against everything that company stood for. But the protesters didn't really relent until they actually backed out of Trump's advisory council. So, I'm all for the protesters standing up and fighting back against this travel ban, but their campaign against Uber is really a place of misplaced energy.

Gigot: James?

Taranto: Paul, a miss to Eliot Spitzer, the former attorney general and briefly governor of New York state. Now that Republicans are in control in Washington, he is suddenly interested in vindicating states' rights. But he writes in "The Republican" there is a problem, and I quote, "How do we go back to all of these cases where we have been ordering for executive discretion --

-- and say, whoops, we did not mean it."

Gigot: Excellent question, Mr. Spitzer.

All right, it is great to see them discovering federalism.

Kim?

Strassel: This is a message to a Travis county judge, Sara Eckhart (ph), in Texas, who is shocked onlookers, when she showed up in her courtroom, wearing a pink hat, the one that is emblematic of the anti-Trump women's marchers. We have since found out that this is a post. She does not hear cases. But she was still sitting in a courtroom expressing solidarity with anti-Trump people. It is amazing to me that anyone can think that this is ever appropriate.

Gigot: All right.

Dan?

Henninger: Paul, since I am a veteran of many past campaigns to help my daughter sell Girl Scout cookies --

-- I am giving a really big hit to New Jersey Girl Scout Charlotte McCork (ph) who sold over 16,000 boxes of these cookies. How did she do this? She did it by putting up a review of the cookies. She said the Samoas are an amazing nine, but that the Toffeetastics (ph) are, quote, "flavorless as dirt." This went viral and everybody got word of it and thousands of orders started pouring in, no doubt, mostly for Samoas.

Gigot: Yeah. Put her as commerce secretary in the Trump administration.

All right, and remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us @JERonFNC.

That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.

World News: U.S. Suggests Path to End Russia Sanctions --- Vice president says move depends on Moscow's cooperation in fight against  ISIS

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday suggested the U.S. could lift sanctions on Russia in the coming months if President Vladimir Putin cooperates with the administration's fight against Islamic State, a remark that came as President Donald Trump faced criticism for appearing to draw an equivalence between Mr. Putin and the behavior of the U.S.

Mr. Pence was responding to ABC's George Stephanopoulos, who asked whether sanctions on Russia would remain in place as long as Moscow continued to violate the cease fire in Ukraine.

"I think that's a question that will be answered in the months ahead. It just simply all depends," Mr. Pence said. He added that the decision would depend on whether "we see the kind of changes in posture by Russia and the opportunity perhaps to work on common interests," including the fighting against Islamic State and other terrorists.

"The president is looking for an opportunity to begin that relationship anew. But, make no mistake about it, those decisions will await action, and they'll be very dependent on how the Russians respond in the days ahead," Mr. Pence said.

In an interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, excerpts of which were released on Saturday, Mr. Trump responded to a remark about Mr. Putin being a "killer" by suggesting the U.S.'s record wasn't flawless, either.

The statement came after Mr. Trump again said he respected the Russian president and that Russia could help in the fight against Islamic State and other terrorists. The full interview was scheduled to air before the Super Bowl on Sunday.

"I say it's better to get along with Russia than not," Mr. Trump said, though he added that he didn't know whether he and Mr. Putin would hit it off.

"But he's a killer," Mr. O'Reilly interjected.

"We've got a lot of killers," Mr. Trump responded after a short pause. "What, you think our country's so innocent?"

Mr. Trump's remarks drew criticism Sunday, including from members of the president's own party, as critics charged the president with being too soft on a nation that is challenging and complicating U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia, at Mr. Putin's direction, mounted a campaign to influence the American election in Mr. Trump's favor through cyber-hacking as part of a broader ambition to undermine Western liberalism. Russia has denied the hacking claim.

Mr. Trump has consistently defended the Russian leader and expressed skepticism about the intelligence community's claims before ultimately agreeing with the agencies' findings.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Sunday on CNN that he didn't want to "critique the president's every utterance," but offered a very different take on Russia and Mr. Putin: "He's a thug. He was not elected in a way that most people would consider a credible election. . . . I don't think there's any equivalency between the way the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does."

Mr. Pence defended the president's comments, telling NBC's Chuck Todd that Mr. Trump was "not in the least" drawing an equivalence between the U.S. and Mr. Putin. "I don't accept that it's a moral equivalency," Mr. Pence said.

The White House also said late Saturday that Mr. Trump had "a very good call" with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, addressing various topics including "Ukraine's long-running conflict with Russia." Russia has denied involvement in a nearly three-year conflict with Ukrainian government forces in Ukraine's east, despite evidence that it provides not only weapons and fighters to pro-Russian separatists there but also its own military units.

How a Republican Bill Led to Countries Named in Donald Trump's Immigration Order; The legislation was aimed at pressuring European allies to share more terror-related intelligence

White House officials had an answer ready when reporters asked how President Donald Trump chose the seven countries whose citizens he temporarily banned from entering the U.S.: He took his cues from the Obama administration.

President Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said in a recent appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the places named in Mr. Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees were "identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists and affirmed by Congress."

Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump's press secretary, repeated the claim during a news conference last Tuesday.

But most of the countries were first identified in legislation introduced by Republicans. The bill, which later passed Congress with bipartisan support, was aimed not at curbing immigration, but at pressuring European allies to share more terror-related intelligence.

The bill was signed by President Barack Obama in 2015. His Department of Homeland Security later added three more countries to the list, using criteria established by the new law.

A spokesman for the Trump White House said Mr. Obama "designated four of the countries when he signed the law and the other three" later on.

The story of how the seven majority-Muslim countries came to be in Mr. Trump's order begins with a 2014 bill introduced by then-Rep. Candice Miller, a Michigan Republican who retired from Congress this year.

The bill sought to tighten the security of a federal program that allows citizens of the U.K., France and three dozen other nations to travel to the U.S. without a visa.

Reports of young Europeans streaming onto battlefields in Iraq and Syria to fight for ISIS or other terrorist organizations alarmed lawmakers, who worried returning fighters could exploit the visa-waiver program to travel undetected to the U.S., according to congressional aides.

Members of the House Homeland Security Committee were concerned countries participating in the visa-waiver program were withholding "vital terrorism data" from the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Intelligence community, according to a committee report on the bill.

Ms. Miller's bill forced countries to turn over intelligence about their citizens with suspected terrorist links or face suspension from the program, which allows eligible foreigners to travel to the U.S. after filling out an online questionnaire.

She introduced an amended version of the bill, which became the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act, the following year. It included the information-sharing provisions and new restrictions on waivers. Citizens from the 38 countries in the program who had made trips to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria since 2011 would be ineligible to enter the U.S. without a visa.

House Republicans said in a 2015 letter to then-Secretary of State John Kerry that Ms. Miller's legislation included Iran because the State Department had classified the country as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984.

An official involved in drafting the legislation said Sudan and Syria, designated as state sponsors in 1993 and 1979, respectively, were placed in the visa waiver bill for the same reason.

Federal law restricts U.S. assistance and defense exports to countries determined by the secretary of state "to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism." The designation is used to pressure governments that support terrorism as a matter of official policy to change their ways.

Ms. Miller, who declined to comment, added Iraq to the bill out of concern about Islamic State, the terrorist group that by 2015 occupied one-third of the country, the official said.

"We didn't want to come up with countries off the top of our heads," the official said.

The November 2015 Paris attacks that killed 130 people gave new urgency to the legislation. Dozens of House members, about a third of them Democrats, signed on as co-sponsors in the days following the attacks, which were planned mostly by citizens of France and Belgium, both members of the visa waiver program.

A stand-alone version of the bill sailed through the House of Representatives by a vote of 407-19. The legislation ultimately passed as part of a spending bill on Dec. 18 and was signed by Mr. Obama the same day.

The new law required the Department of Homeland Security to decide whether travel to any additional countries should disqualify people from obtaining visa waivers. It established broad criteria, including whether travel to a given country "increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States."

The department added Libya, Somalia and Yemen, all failed or near-failed states, to the list of disqualifying countries last year, bringing the total to seven. The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to a request for comment.

The law didn't impact the travel of citizens from those seven nations to the U.S. They could still obtain a visa, until Jan. 27 when Mr. Trump signed his order.

From a Jan. 30 report by CBS News:

BAGHDAD -- Gen. Talib al Kenani commands the elite American-trained counter terrorist forces that have been leading the fight against ISIS for two years.

"I'm a four star general, and I'm banned from entering the U.S.?" he said.

His family was relocated to the U.S. for their safety, and he'd had plans to see them next week, until he was told not to bother.

"I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning," he said. "Now my kids are now asking if I'm a terrorist?" . . .

"This ban needs to be reviewed," Kenani said. "We thought we were partners with our American friends, and now we realize that we're just considered terrorists."

Politics & Ideas: Nothing Redeems Trump's Travel Ban

President Trump's executive order temporarily halting the admission of all refugees as well as individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries is deeply misguided. I will spare my readers an extended soliloquy on the violence the order does to our identity as a "nation of immigrants," even though it has what I fear is the increasingly antique merit of truth, in favor of more concrete concerns.

First, the order is probably unconstitutional. As federal Judge Ann Donnelly wrote in issuing an emergency stay preventing two refugees from being returned to their home countries, "The petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that [their removal] violates the rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution." To be sure, the petitioners are not citizens. But the 14th Amendment distinguishes clearly between the privileges and immunities of "citizens," on the one hand, and the due-process and equal-protection rights of "persons" on the other.

The president's executive order may also violate the Establishment Clause. The White House insists that the order does not create a religious test for immigrants, but there are two indications to the contrary. Over the weekend, former Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that after Mr. Trump announced a "Muslim ban" during the campaign, the candidate came to him and said "put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally." Unsurprisingly, Mr. Giuliani produced a Muslim ban in drag.

Moreover, the language of the executive order makes it clear that after the temporary suspension ends, non-Muslims will receive preferential treatment. The secretaries of state and homeland security are directed to give priority to refugee claims made by individuals citing religious persecution, "provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality." For refugees from many of the world's most dangerous places, this excludes Muslims -- including Muslims from a Sunni-majority country such as Syria, whose government is dominated by a Shiite minority.

Setting aside constitutional issues, the executive order is of dubious legality. The United States' fundamental immigration statute, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, forbids discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas based on an individual's "race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence." On its face, excluding potential immigrants from specific countries violates the law.

In response, the Trump administration points to a 1952 law that permits the president to suspend the entry of any class of aliens that he determines to be contrary to the national interest. But as the Cato Institute's David Bier observes, the 1965 act modifies and restricts the power, with exceptions only as provided by Congress. As Justice Robert Jackson observed: "When the President takes measures incompatible with the . . . will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb."

Legal issues aside, the executive order does not meet the test of sound public policy. Refugees are already subject to what Mr. Trump calls "extreme vetting," a process that lasts anywhere from 18 months to four years. This is why, as my Brookings Institution colleague Daniel Byman points out, "Syrian refugees are linked to zero terrorist attacks in the United States."

The order also punishes immigrants and refugees who fear for their lives because they cooperated with the U.S. armed forces and other American entities. One of the individuals detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport had served as a translator for the U.S. Army and as an engineer on U.S.-funded reconstruction projects. Targeted for assassination, first in Baghdad and then in Kirkuk, he applied for and received a special immigrant visa based on a determination that he had provided "faithful and valuable service to the United States" and was experiencing a serious threat as a consequence of this service.

If this is the thanks foreign nationals can expect to receive, why would they ever cooperate with the U.S.?

Along with injustice to individuals is the damage the order inflicts on American foreign policy. Speaking for the vast majority of policy experts and former senior officials, Richard Haass, the longtime president of the Council on Foreign Relations, says: "If you're ISIS, this is a good day. This is a recruiting boon for you. It . . . sends the message 'The Americans are at war with Islam,' just as we -- ISIS -- have been saying all along."

Most troubling is the message the executive order sends about the current condition of the United States. President Trump would have us cower fearfully behind a legal Maginot Line, animated by an illusory quest for perfect security, whatever the costs to our interests and our principles. We cannot be the "land of the free" unless we are the "home of the brave." There's a word for the sentiments underlying the president's order, and it's not bravery.

What Will Trump's Immigration Ban Actually Accomplish? None of the attackers from 9/11 or San Bernardino would have been thwarted by the new rule.

Can we stipulate that President Trump's new policy on refugees is problematic while also stipulating that Barack Obama is chief among those who have no business criticizing it?

Mr. Obama issued a statement Monday expressing solidarity with opponents of Mr. Trump's executive order— rule aimed at addressing a refugee mess created in large part by Mr. Obama's own foreign-policy blunders. The last president prematurely withdrew American troops from Iraq. He made an empty threat that Syria's Assad regime would face "enormous consequences" if it used chemical weapons. These mistakes have damaged American credibility and led to the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II.

One reason Mr. Trump won the White House is that voters are anxious about their personal safety. Deadly terror attacks on civilians in places like Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, Calif., have forced many Americans to rethink the longstanding open-door policies. Groups like Islamic State, it seems, can instigate or inspire acts of terrorism when and where they choose. Voters trusted Mr. Trump, more than his opponent, to keep the country safe.

The new executive order, which temporarily bars new refugees as well as travelers from seven countries with Muslim-majority populations, reflects this public mood. As a candidate, Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to enact strict vetting measures to keep out potential Islamic terrorists. After a man who had pledged allegiance to ISIS gunned down 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., last June, Mr. Trump once again called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Media outrage ensued, but a poll taken at the time showed that 48% of respondents sided with Mr. Trump, while only 40% were opposed.

The president is winning praise from supporters for keeping a campaign promise. Still, the nation deserves a less clumsy shift in border policy and a more thorough explanation of why these changes are necessary. Mr. Trump has said his order will make the country safer, and border security can of course always be improved, but what is the value-added of the new measures? As even the White House acknowledges, travelers from the seven designated countries were already under extra scrutiny from the previous administration.

Mr. Trump also hasn't explained whether the new policy would have prevented recent attacks had it been in place. Most terrorism in the U.S. is carried out by American citizens. And "not a single American has died as a result of terrorist attacks committed by any citizen of the seven banned countries in this millennium," explains Lyman Stone in the Federalist. "Additionally, countries whose citizens have perpetrated attacks, like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, were not banned."

The administration has invoked both the San Bernardino shooting rampage and 9/11 in rolling out the new policy. But neither of the San Bernardino shooters would have been affected by the new restrictions. And the 9/11 hijackers hailed from Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—ll Muslim-majority countries that were excluded from the executive order.

Mr. Trump has also cited Europe's refugee problem as a cautionary tale, and it's indisputable that some European countries have done a poor job of screening people who arrived at the border seeking asylum. However, the ringleader of the 2015 Paris attack that claimed 130 lives was a Belgian national, and nearly all of the others involved were born in the European Union and held EU passports that allowed them to travel freely. By the Trump administration's logic, shouldn't European nations also be included in the ban?

One of the more valid concerns with Mr. Trump's executive order is that it may give Americans a false sense of security and further complicate our relationship with Muslim allies. Travel bans have their uses, and it's common sense that some foreigners will be screened more rigorously than others because resources are limited. But the policy makers who spend their time thinking about how to safeguard the country express equal or greater concern about homegrown threats—he radicalization of people already living here, not just those trying to get in.

Here again, Mr. Trump is inheriting not only a bad situation but one that was allowed to fester on his predecessor's watch. "The U.S. government lacks a national strategy for combating terrorist travel and has not produced one in nearly a decade," according to a comprehensive 2015 analysis by the House Committee on Homeland Security. "The unprecedented speed at which Americans are being radicalized by violent extremists is straining federal law enforcement's ability to monitor and intercept suspects." The report concluded: "Ultimately, severing today's foreign-fighter flows depends on eliminating the problem at the source in Syria and Iraq."

Mr. Obama's commitment to rooting out ISIS was little more than rhetorical. We'll find out if Mr. Trump's goes beyond issuing travel bans.

Nothing Redeems Trump's Travel Ban; It probably violates both the Constitution and statutes, and it's bad public policy.

Good morning,

You're Fired

The White House on Monday fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for telling government lawyers not to defend an executive order signed by President Donald Trumpsuspending immigration from seven countries out of concerns that terrorists from those countries might enter the U.S. Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, will be acting attorney general until Mr. Trump's nominee, Jeff Sessions, is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, which could happen next week. The Justice Department standoff was the latest in a series of extraordinary events since Mr. Trump signed his order on Friday night, sparking confusion and protests at airports around the U.S., as well as condemnation from executives at blue-chip companies such as Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Ford. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump will amend a recent executive action so he can add CIA director Mike Pompeo into a role on the National Security Council. Mr. Trump is also scheduled to name his Supreme Court nominee today in a prime-time address.

Friend Request

 Facebook is trying everything to re-enter China—nd it's not working. Blocked on China's internet since 2009, the social-media giant has courted Chinese officials, made Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg more visible in China, hired a well-connected China-policy chief and begun developing technology that could cull content the Communist Party deems unacceptable. It has made no visible headway. And as time passes, Facebook is watching from the outside as Chinese companies mop up the market that might have been its own. Facebook faces a wary central government, which blamed social media for stirring ethnic unrest in 2009 and remains uneasy with the company's ability to be a dissidents' megaphone. Meanwhile, Facebook is aiming to be more essential to its 1.79 billion existing users, unveiling new technology to let them reset passwords for other websites using its platform.

Bitter Pill

Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid have agreed to reduce the amount Walgreens would pay for its rival by at least $2 billion, after the two companies struggled to get antitrust enforcers to bless the big drugstore deal. The companies said Monday they would look to sell more stores as they seek to satisfy regulators at the Federal Trade Commission, which has been reviewing the combination. The process may take up to six months, they said. Walgreens in October 2015 agreed to buy Rite Aid for $9 a share, or about $9.4 billion, to form a drugstore chain with more than 10,000 U.S. stores. FTC officials had raised concern that such a big company could hold too much sway in negotiations with pharmacy-benefits managers such as CVS Health's Caremark or Express Scripts Holding, which handle corporate and government drug plans.

Face the Facts

How can we cut through our resistance to unwanted information? We avoid looking at our bank accounts after paying the bills, resist stepping on a scale after the holidays, refuse to schedule preventive health tests. Researchers call this behavior information avoidance or strategic ignorance. We do it to avoid facts that make us feel bad, obligate us to do something we don't want to do, or challenge how we see ourselves, others or the world. Some avoid unwanted information because they might not have the financial or psychological resources to deal with that information. But we report that research shows that when people feel they have some control over the outcome of information, they're more likely to agree to hear it. We also offer strategies for facing the truth.

Reader Response

Responding to yesterday's question on Mr. Trump's executive order restricting immigration, Kristy Olshan of Pennsylvania wrote: "I'm encouraged by Mr. Trump's executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim nations and candidly actions like this should have been taken much sooner to protect the American people." Bob Harris of New Jersey said: "This is exactly what he promised to do in the campaign. If anyone says he has no support for this action from the public, who do the naysayers think voted for him?" Joe Williams of Kansas shared: "Our ban is now their rallying cry. It will be used as conclusive evidence by ISIS that they were right when they proclaimed us the enemy of all Islam. We were great before Mr. Trump and Steve Bannon came to power. Will we be great when they're finished?" Barbara Courtney of Washington weighed in: "Mr. Trump's immigration ban was crafted and announced with no regard for the families it has already affected, for the people who are on the front line of enforcing it, for its legality, and for the message it sends to allies and foes around the world. It is amateur and shameful." And Barbara Arena of Florida commented: "If the Statue of Liberty could cry, tears would be streaming down her face."
