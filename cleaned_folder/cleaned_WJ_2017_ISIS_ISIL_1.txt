This week was hail and farewell. Thursday morning William Cohen, the former Republican senator who became Bill Clinton's secretary of defense, introduced and endorsed Gen. James N. Mattis, Donald Trump's nominee as defense chief, to the Senate Armed Services Committee. "He has the nickname of ‘ad Dog'—t's a misnomer," Mr. Cohen said. "It should be Braveheart." Sam Nunn, a Democratic former senator, also praised the nominee's character and credentials. Gen. Mattis is that vanishingly rare thing in Washington, a figure of almost universal respect. His confirmation is expected.

The day before, in his confirmation hearings at the Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson came across as distinguished, calm, informed. In intense questioning, Sen. Marco Rubio was strangely, yippily hostile. "Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?" Mr. Rubio pressed. "I would not use that term," Mr. Tillerson replied, blandly, but with an expression that allowed you to imagine a thought bubble: You can mess with me, son, but it won't end well for you. In the end, Mr. Rubio did Mr. Tillerson no harm and himself no good. A few hours in, with his accent and cool demeanor, I realized who Mr. Tillerson was reminding me of: former Secretary of State James Baker.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, was cuffed about in his sessions but emerged relatively unscathed. Rep. Mike Pompeo, Mr. Trump's pick to head the CIA, was up Thursday. He was creditable, composed, informed. Also that day Gen. John Kelly, nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security, drew bipartisan support. He was introduced by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who said: "I would trust him with my life."

It was interesting that all of Mr. Trump's nominees made clear they would have no problem disagreeing with the incoming president on issues such as immigration, torture and Russia. Gen. Mattis said, bluntly, that he's "all for engagement," but we must recognize "there's a decreasing number of areas where we can engage cooperatively, and an increasing number of areas where we're going to have to confront Russia." The nominees' independence may reassure some of the president-elect's foes without putting off most of his supporters: They'd expect a degree of dissent among professionals and will want him surrounded by respectful, independent operators.

Such hearings are televised in part so interested citizens can form their own opinions. They likely received a generally positive impression.

President Obama meanwhile delivered his farewell address, at a semi-raucous and sentimental rally in Chicago. There was nothing terrible in it and little strikingly good. In the tradition of presidential warnings, he spoke of the need to work harder for economic opportunity and racial harmony. We are too divided, sort ourselves out and away from each other, and "keep talking past each other." We are increasingly stuck in cultural and intellectual enclaves, and choose whatever news we're inclined to believe. All true.

Mr. Obama's has not been a successful presidency. In foreign affairs his two terms, added to George W. Bush's two terms, produced 16 years of unsuccess—n entire generation. Richard Haass, head of the Council on Foreign Relations, put it gently in conversation this week: Mr. Bush tried to do too much, which was unrealistic; Mr. Obama attempted too little, its own, perhaps more consequential unrealism.

In domestic matters he put all his chips on health care and bullied it through without a single Republican vote, leaving his party fully owning it and the other with no investment in saving it. His relationship with Congress started out at impasse, proceeded to fraught and ended in estrangement. He saw this all as the other side's fault. In his dealings with the Hill he was often imperious, sometimes a snot. He allowed executive agencies such as the IRS to ruin their public reputations and stonewall scandal after scandal. His most famous words as president came not in formal addresses but extemporaneous misjudgments—red line," ISIS as the "jayvee team"—lus an attempt to mislead: "If you like your plan, you can keep your plan."

He left his party weaker, in terms of public offices held, than at any point since the 1920s.

He spent an unprecedented amount of time campaigning against, and assailing in the bitterest terms, his successor. Donald Trump was "uniquely unqualified," "temperamentally unfit." America chose him anyway. They were choosing Mr. Obama's exact opposite, just as in choosing Sen. Obama in 2008 they went with the opposite of Mr. Bush. When they want the opposite of what you are, they are not registering approval.

Yet Mr. Obama's approval ratings are at a respectable 55%. I think I know some of why.

I was speaking at a college down South this past fall. The students were impressive, kindly, racially mixed, almost all working-class. An administrator said proudly that most were the first in their families to attend college. In my talk I compared the past five presidents, noting one thing each could have learned, to his benefit, from his predecessor. But the evening ran late, and wanting to sum up quickly I gave Mr. Obama short shrift, not affording him the same degree of regard and respect I'd given his predecessors. The students had been listening and laughing, but here the room turned cool. I knew I'd been unjust but couldn't turn it around; it was too late to amend. I knew I had disappointed these students, especially, but not only, young black men. They were too polite to say anything, but I felt it.

Afterward I thought about it a lot. I had seen that night something I'd missed—hat Obama was to the young, especially those who came from families of stress and need. If you were 12 when Obama was elected, and grew up with a mother or grandmother and that's it, and that mother or grandmother maybe didn't always treat you so well, and you had no one around to teach you, on a daily basis, how to be a man, show you what a man does, and you saw him acting with careful, conscious dignity, with his intact family and his personal poise—aybe that just meant a lot. Maybe it gave you hints. And maybe when you saw him celebrating those who in whatever way are different, or feel different, that meant something too.

Barack Obama had dignity in his personal sphere. He carried himself with confidence, like someone with self-respect. You gathered, as you watched over eight years, that he did what a man does, taking care of his family, his wife and children. He didn't talk about it but he modeled it, represented it in his actions. This, in an increasingly less parented country, was valuable. I didn't give enough weight to it until after that night at the college.

I put it here to remind everyone, mostly myself, that you can strongly oppose someone politically, really think you're seeing bad things there, but have a responsibility to see and note what good there is.

We're losing that ability, in our enclaves.

He has said that he's touched a rising generation. To some significant degree I have a feeling that will probably prove true.

World News: Lebanon Seeks to Rebuild Saudi Alliance

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Lebanon's new Hezbollah-supported president is courting Saudi Arabia in an effort to restore billions in military aid, a delicate task as his country grows closer to Iran, the kingdom's main rival for Middle East power.

Michel Aoun's country has for years been a political battleground in the regional struggle between Iran, the backer of the Lebanese Shiite militant and political group Hezbollah, and Saudi Arabia, a supporter of the country's main Sunni bloc.

The ascendancy of Mr. Aoun, Hezbollah's main Christian ally, was a victory for the group -- and a sign of the waning influence in Lebanon of Saudi Arabia, which had opposed his candidacy.

Now, Mr. Aoun is reaching out to Riyadh in an effort to show that Lebanon hasn't fallen into Tehran's orbit. At stake for Beirut is around $3 billion worth of military aid that Saudi Arabia suspended last year in February in retaliation for Hezbollah's dominance of Lebanese politics.

The Lebanese leader visited Saudi Arabia this week to meet King Salman.

A top item on the agenda of Mr. Aoun's two-day trip, which ended Tuesday, was to persuade the Sunni kingdom to resume those payments, intended to purchase weapons and other equipment from France. Lebanon would also like Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to lift a travel warning on the country that they issued last year.

"I am here to dispel ambiguities that arose, and carry affection and friendship for the Saudi people," Mr. Aoun told Saudi television channel Al Ekhbariya.

The Saudi government hasn't said whether it is considering restoring aid. Saudi officials didn't respond to requests to comment.

Securing such aid could help Lebanon contain the spillover from the war in neighboring Syria. Lebanon's army is battling extremists along the border affiliated with al Qaeda and Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

"Lebanon's army is currently fighting ISIS on the Lebanese border, and it needs all the support it can get," said Lebanese lawmaker Alain Aoun, a nephew of the president.

As Riyadh became entangled with the wars in Yemen and Syria, where it backs opposite sides from Iran, Lebanon slid down the kingdom's list of priorities. Frustrated by Hezbollah's elevation into the country's most powerful military and political force in recent years, Riyadh has punished Lebanon economically, instructing its deep-pocketed citizens to avoid traveling to the country.

But disengaging from Lebanon has come at a political cost. The backing of Hezbollah -- which Saudi Arabia and the U.S. consider a terrorist organization -- helped Mr. Aoun secure the votes he needed in parliament to be elected president.

Under established power-sharing agreements in Lebanon, the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shiite.

Saudi Minister of State Thamer al-Sabhan, who has spearheaded the kingdom's re-engagement with Lebanon, said Saudi Arabia hopes to see a strong government contain the influence of Hezbollah and Iran.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last month said his party didn't oppose Mr. Aoun's outreach to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia—ebanon's new Hezbollah-supported president is courting Saudi Arabia in an effort to restore billions in military aid, a delicate task as his country grows closer to Iran, the kingdom's main rival for Middle East power.

Michel Aoun's country has for years been a political battleground in the regional struggle between Iran, the backer of the Lebanese Shiite militant and political group Hezbollah, and Saudi Arabia, a supporter of the country's main Sunni bloc.

The ascendancy of Mr. Aoun, Hezbollah's main Christian ally, was a victory for the group—nd a sign of the waning influence in Lebanon of Saudi Arabia, which had opposed his candidacy.

Now, Mr. Aoun is reaching out to Riyadh in an effort to show that Lebanon hasn't fallen into Tehran's orbit. At stake for Beirut is around $3 billion worth of military aid that Saudi Arabia suspended last year  in February in retaliation for Hezbollah's dominance of Lebanese politics.

The Lebanese leader visited Saudi Arabia this week to meet King Salman, in his first foreign visit as president.

A top item on the agenda of Mr. Aoun's two-day trip, which ended Tuesday, was to persuade the Sunni kingdom to resume those payments, intended to purchase weapons and other equipment from France. Lebanon would also like Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to lift a travel warning on the tiny Mediterranean country they issued last year.

"I am here to dispel ambiguities that arose, and carry affection and friendship for the Saudi people," Mr. Aoun told Saudi television channel Al Ekhbariya.

The Saudi government hasn't said whether it is considering restoring aid. Saudi officials didn't respond to requests for comment.

"Lebanon's army is currently fighting ISIS on the Lebanese border, and it needs all the support it can get," said Lebanese lawmaker Alain Aoun, a nephew of the president.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault last month told reporters in Beirut that with the formation of a new government "the conditions were favorable" for the resumption of aid. Mr. Aoun's victory ended a political stalemate that left the country without a president for more than two years.

As Riyadh became entangled with the wars in Yemen and Syria, where it backs opposite sides from Iran, Lebanon slid down the kingdom's list of priorities.

Frustrated by Hezbollah's elevation into the country's most powerful military and political force in recent years, Riyadh has punished Lebanon economically, instructing its deep-pocketed citizens to avoid traveling  to the country. Saudi Arabia's Gulf allies issued similar travel warnings.

But disengaging from Lebanon has come at a political cost.

The backing of Hezbollah—hich Saudi Arabia and the U.S. consider a terrorist organization—elped Mr. Aoun secure the votes he needed in parliament to be elected president.

Under established power-sharing agreements in Lebanon, the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shiite.

In a sign that Riyadh is reconsidering its stance, the kingdom at the last minute publicly threw its support behind Sunni politician Saad Hariri, a longtime ally, who became prime minister  as part of a deal with Mr. Aoun. Several high-level Saudi delegations have visited Lebanon in recent months.

Saudi Minister of State Thamer al-Sabhan, who has spearheaded the kingdom's re-engagement with Lebanon, said Saudi Arabia hopes to see a strong government contain the influence of Hezbollah and Iran.

"The presence of arms in the hands of Hezbollah threatens [the Lebanese people] directly and it is important for [them] to have the ability, through a strong state, to stop Hezbollah's hostile actions," he said in an interview after Mr. Aoun's election.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last month said his party didn't oppose Mr. Aoun's outreach to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. "We are facing a new era that will see new relations developing for the benefit of Lebanon with all countries, except for the enemy we all agree on," a reference to Israel, he said in a televised speech.

Art and Life Collide in ‘omeland' and ‘4:Legacy'; Writers on TV series such as ‘omeland' and ‘4: Legacy' aim to create riveting dramas without sensationalizing real-life terrorism

Filming the climax of the most recent season of "Homeland," the producers saw their TV fiction collide with a ghastly reality. The shoot, in November 2015, featured an attempted poison-gas attack in a Berlin rail station. Just days before, violence had engulfed the real city of Paris. Terrorists affiliated with Islamic State killed 130 people in an assault centered on the Bataclan concert hall.

"It was a profoundly disturbing moment for all of us," says Alex Gansa, lead writer and producer of the Showtime series. The Berlin finale was shot as planned, but his team's soul searching—ere they sensationalizing?—ncreased their commitment to realism for the sixth season, premiering Sunday.

"We didn't want to falsely portray dangers that don't exist. There's enough fear, fear-mongering and real causes for fear that we needed to not pile on," Mr. Gansa adds.

"Homeland" returns within weeks of the TV franchise that laid the groundwork for it: "24," which started two months after 9/11 and played out as a hot-blooded response to the 2001 attacks. In "24: Legacy," a spinoff premiering Feb. 5 on Fox, the hero is a former Army Ranger being hunted by a terrorist death squad.

Creators of these shows are grappling with producing escapist drama that sometimes mirrors real attacks across the world. They have to keep up with current events yet not exploit them. Adding to the tension (and providing story fodder for thrillers as well as series in other genres) is a new and unpredictable administration coming to the White House.

"There is a responsibility. You can't just hide behind the fact that it's a TV show," says Howard Gordon, an executive producer of "Homeland" and "24: Legacy." As the "24" showrunner for the series's most popular and polarizing seasons during the 2000s, Mr. Gordon faced blowback over protagonist Jack Bauer torturing people to extract information about looming attacks. Amid revelations about prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, critics wondered if the show was normalizing torture.

"My conscience is a lot more sensitive than it was 15 years ago," Mr. Gordon says. "Because [TV] has so much reach, you have to recognize that the stuff you're doing is going to be scrutinized."

The ticking-clock format of "24," with each episode spanning one hour in a potentially catastrophic day for society, meant that the show was over the top by definition. "24: Legacy" also operates on overdrive, but producers say they have tried to ground the series in reality. Gone are the weapons of mass destruction that Jack Bauer raced to intercept, replaced by radicalized youth and the threat of grassroots attacks in unexpected places.

"They're not nuclear bombs, but in their own way they're just as horrifying because they really hit you on a level that you can understand," says executive producer Manny Coto.

He points out that the narrative unfolds in a "parallel universe" distinct from the real world. "‘4' is its own extrapolation of the worst possible scenario" of terrorism, says Mr. Coto, who co-created "24: Legacy" with Evan Katz. Both men were writers and producers on the original "24," which spanned nine seasons and a TV movie.

Other series are exploring the intersection of counterterrorism and politics at a moment of heightened uncertainty in both domains. ABC's "Designated Survivor" (returning in March for the second half of its first season) stars Kiefer Sutherland, Jack Bauer in the original "24," whose character becomes president after a bombing wipes out much of the government. The show has presented a cornucopia of threats, from document leaks to a ricin scare.

In "Six," premiering Jan. 18 on History, fictional members of Navy SEAL Team Six regroup to rescue a comrade (Walton Goggins) kidnapped by militant Islamist group Boko Haram.

"24" and "Homeland" share some creative DNA. After "24," Mr. Gordon created "Homeland" with Mr. Gansa, a longtime friend and former writer on ‘24" who has been the showrunner on "Homeland" from the start. Mr. Gordon still has a hand in that show as an executive producer, but spends most of his time shepherding "24: Legacy."

"Homeland," adapted from an Israeli TV series, gave them a clean slate. Like "24," it imagined grand-scale domestic attacks, but also examined the ripple effects from the global war on terror. Viewers have found themselves sympathizing with a fictional U.S. Marine who had been turned against his country while being held hostage by an al Qaeda leader.

"‘omeland' has had a chance to explore those things with a lot more depth and nuance than ‘4' ever could and ever will be able to," Mr. Gordon says.

Season 6 of "Homeland" is set in New York City. The show introduces a character named Sekou Bah (J. Mallory McCree), who attracts FBI scrutiny for his firebrand internet posts. He uploads a series of videos of sites related to real-life events in New York, such as Faisal Shahzad's unsuccessful attempt to detonate a car bomb in Times Square.

The storyline dwells more on Sekou Bah testing the limits of free speech than a hypothetical threat to New York. That decision came out of an annual trip that "Homeland" writers make to Washington for research. They get off-the-record tutorials from White House officials, journalists and intelligence veterans, including former CIA director Michael Hayden.

"We were told that there aren't coordinated ISIS or al Qaeda networks in the U.S. like there are in Europe," Mr. Gansa says. Thus, a made-up narrative about a local plot to cripple New York would be "counterfactual and it would be bad karma."

Instead, writers zeroed in on the "delicate process" of the transfer of presidential power. The entire season takes place in the weeks leading up to a fictional president's inauguration. Elizabeth Marvel plays the New York-based president-elect. In the premiere, she is briefed by intelligence chiefs and expresses skepticism about their agenda and methods.

The episode was shot long before Donald Trump won the White House and went on to dismiss intelligence agencies' report that Russia tried to hack the election. In response to the plague of fake news during the real U.S. campaign, "Homeland" writers expanded on a character who spreads disinformation about the president-elect before she is sworn in.

Corey Hawkins (best known for playing Dr. Dre in "Straight Outta Compton") plays the hero of "24: Legacy"—ric Carter. He's a young soldier, not a grizzled agent with baggage like Jack Bauer. The new protagonist's motivation seems less clear cut than his predecessor's. As an African-American, Mr. Carter is a patriot questioning what it means to protect "a country that has often been less than good to black people," Mr. Gordon says.

Current events weren't the only thing that influenced the producers' decision to resurrect "24." They also hoped the weekly race-the-clock format of "24: Legacy" can grab viewers at a time when many have given up on broadcast television or ignore shows until they can binge-watch.​It's gotten harder and harder to hold the audience's attention," Mr. Coto says. "That's one thing ‘4' was always good at."

U.S. Raid Kills Islamic State Official in Syria; Delta Force conducted a raid in eastern Syria to capture a militant leader and killed ‘ small number' of fighters

WASHINGTON—he U.S. military's Delta Force killed an Islamic State official during a raid in eastern Syria over the weekend that was meant to capture the militant leader, a U.S. official said Monday.

The operation was conducted by the Expeditionary Targeting Force, elite troops commonly known as Delta Force. The raid didn't result in the capture of any militants, though a "small number" were killed during the fight near Deir Ezzour in Syria, the official said.

Such raids are typically not publicized by the Pentagon, but Sunday's was reported by local media, prompting a response from the Pentagon, which leads an international coalition helping to fight Islamic State in Syria. "The coalition can confirm a U.S. operation in the vicinity of Deir Ezzor," said a statement, using another name for Islamic State..

"The U.S. and the entire counter-ISIL Coalition will continue to pursue ISIL leaders wherever they are to ensure the security and stability of the region and our homelands," it added, using an acronym for Islamic State.

A local website, DeirEzzor24, reported that a group of commandos, including U.S. and Arab forces, landed by parachute on the outskirts of the town and arrested a number of Islamic State fighters before leaving. The website said no civilians were in harm's way during the operation.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Monday that at least 25 Islamic State militants were killed during "an operation carried out by helicopter believed to belong to the International Coalition," the website reported.

The U.S. official said the team was made up entirely of U.S. commandos, didn't land by parachute and didn't make any arrests. The person targeted in the operation was killed in a firefight with the commandos, the official said. The Pentagon didn't identify the individual or say why the person was targeted by the operation.

U.S. special operations forces have steadily increased their presence in Syria and Iraq since the beginning of operations to push Islamic State from those countries. Americans often advise local forces and sometimes join them in operations.

A Delta Force commando, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler, was killed in 2015 when his unit assisted Kurdish Peshmerga forces on a raid near Kirkuk, Iraq, becoming the first American to be killed in action in Iraq since 2011 in Iraq.

In May 2015, U.S. special operations forces killed Abu Sayyaf, who ran Islamic State's oil operations, in a raid at his compound in Deir Ezzour province. The mission also captured a trove of documents and Mr. Abu Sayyaf's wife.

The Pentagon hasn't said how many operations U.S. forces have undertaken in Iraq and Syria, unaccompanied by local troops.

Syrian Kurds Deserve a Seat at the Negotiating Table

By Stuart Rollo

The beginning of 2017 is shaping up to be a critical period in the Syrian Kurds' campaign to defeat Islamic State and secure a measure of political autonomy in their homeland. How President-elect Trump manages the competing interests and alliances in Syria will directly affect the Kurds' destiny. He ought to stand with these steadfast American partners.

Since 2012 the Syrian Kurds have occupied a precarious political position. They have been crucial American allies against ISIS. The Russian government has also courted them, particularly during Russia's period of intense enmity with Turkey in late 2015. For long stretches the Syrian Kurds have also participated in an unofficial truce with Syrian President Bashar Assad's government.

Amid this tangle of relationships, the Kurds' connection with Turkish President Recep Erdogan may be the most important in whether they will secure some form of autonomy. Mr. Erdogan views them as a threat to Turkish territorial integrity, due to their alleged links with the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party, known by the Turkish acronym PKK.

Mr. Erdogan was an early supporter of the Free Syrian Army, but as the conflict progressed and the rebellion was taken over by radical Islamists, Turkey shifted its support to those groups, including Ahrar al-Sham and Faylaq Al-Sham. Ankara did this with the hope of replacing the Alawite Assad regime with a Sunni-led government, which would owe Turkey its allegiance.

Turkey hosted Syrian political dissidents in the earliest stages of the rebellion and provided the Free Syrian Army with a secure base of operations within Turkey. Arms from Saudi Arabia and Qatar were flown into Turkey en masse and distributed to rebel groups across the border. As the conflict escalated and militant Islamist groups, including ISIS and Jabhat Al-Nusra, became the most powerful rebel factions, Turkey continued facilitating the flow of arms, cash and recruits across its border.

Turkish involvement in Syria has hurt its relationships with the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. has often seen Turkey's involvement as hampering the war against ISIS. Turkish support for the rebellion is contrary to Russia's actions to preserve the Assad regime, and the downing of a Russian warplane by the Turkish military in August 2015 saw the nadir of an already troubled relationship. Turkey has also been accused by international media as well as by the Russian government of supporting various terrorist groups, including ISIS. This has hurt its international reputation as a responsible steward of regional stability.

Mr. Erdogan continued to pursue regime change in Syria long after it had become clear that the U.S. wouldn't intervene to topple Mr. Assad. However, when Aleppo fell to regime forces in December, Turkey co-sponsored with Russia a cease-fire, which was signed Dec. 30.

Now Turkey's main priority is to suppress Kurdish autonomy in Syria. The Turks are using the cease-fire to marginalize the Kurds by escalating their military assault on Kurdish positions. On the same day the cease-fire went into effect, the Kurdish media reported that Turkish military and Turkish-backed Islamist rebels were attacking Kurdish towns and militia security offices.

The Assad regime is also putting pressure on the Kurds and insisting they acknowledge the regime's authority. In a Dec. 27 meeting with Kurdish representatives, the regime offered support as long as the Kurds vowed to back Assad in upcoming elections. The regime also demanded that the Kurds abandon their pursuit of a federal system for Syria and hoist the Syrian flag over government buildings and offices.

During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump argued that we should be "arming" Kurdish fighters. "They have proven to be the best fighters, they have proven to be the most loyal to us," he said. Now under pressure from all sides, Syrian Kurds are counting on Mr. Trump to follow through.

Yet political support is more crucial than arms. The Trump administration should make clear that its support for the Kurds extends beyond the fight with ISIS. He should affirm their right to self-directed political and civil representation in Syria. The best way to start is by insisting that the Syrian Kurds have a seat at the table in negotiating an end to the Syrian civil war.

The U.S. has a mixed record with arming the Kurds and encouraging their ambitions for self-determination. American support has been instrumental in the success of the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq, but Washington has also abandoned the Iraqi Kurds many times.

If the new American president stands firm, the State Department will have to balance U.S. support for Syrian Kurds with assurances to Turkey that the PKK will not be empowered. Fully siding with Turkey will go down as another cynical betrayal.

World News: U.S. Defense Secretary Says Russia No Help on  ISIS

WASHINGTON -- Russia has done nothing to help defeat Islamic State forces in Syria and has adopted a strategy of "explicitly thwarting the U.S." elsewhere, outgoing Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Carter, who has a long history of working with Russian officials, said Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to blunt U.S. influence have increased and are making it harder to find areas in which Washington and Moscow can work together.

"I think it is something that has grown steadily under Putin's leadership," he said. "It seems to be part of his self-conception. And one of the ways he defines the success of his policy is not by results on the ground but the level of the discomfort he can create in the rest of the world and show to his people as the point of his policy."

He added, "That's what makes it so difficult to build a bridge" to Russia's leaders.

Mr. Carter, who will leave his Pentagon office as President-elect Donald Trump takes over later this month, said he wasn't attempting to advise the incoming administration. But his appraisal of Russian behavior, in Syria and beyond, stands in stark contrast with the analysis Mr. Trump and some of his advisers have offered of Russia generally and Mr. Putin specifically.

Mr. Trump has said he admires Mr. Putin as a leader, has said he would like a better relationship with Russia in general, and has specifically cited Russia as a potential ally in defeating Islamic State forces.

But Mr. Carter bluntly said the Russian military, as it has taken on an increasingly assertive role in shoring up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in recent months, has been unhelpful in the fight against Islamic State forces, also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL.

"They haven't done anything to fight ISIL," he said. "They've been fighting the moderate opposition along with the Syrian government. Everything they've done has been wrong headed and completely the obverse of what they said they were going to do."

Russian leaders also haven't fulfilled their promise to use their foothold in Syria to "facilitate a transition" away from the Assad regime to a broader government that includes the moderate opposition to Mr. Assad, Mr. Carter said.

"They haven't done that," he said. "They haven't facilitated that transition. They've just doubled down on the civil war."

As Mr. Carter's comments suggest, Russia has emerged as the national-security issue on which the contrast between the outgoing Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration is most striking.

Opinion
Syrian Kurds Deserve a Seat at the Negotiating Table; President-elect Trump should arm the Kurds and fight for their autonomy in the region.

The beginning of 2017 is shaping up to be a critical period in the Syrian Kurds' campaign to defeat Islamic State and secure a measure of political autonomy in their homeland. How President-elect Trump manages the competing interests and alliances in Syria will directly affect the Kurds' destiny. He ought to stand with these steadfast American partners.

Since 2012 the Syrian Kurds have occupied a precarious political position. They have been crucial American allies against ISIS. The Russian government has also courted them, particularly during Russia's period of intense enmity with Turkey in late 2015. For long stretches the Syrian Kurds have also participated in an unofficial truce with Syrian President Bashar Assad's government.

Amid this tangle of relationships, the Kurds' connection with Turkish President Recep Erdogan may be the most important in whether they will secure some form of autonomy. Mr. Erdogan views them as a threat to Turkish territorial integrity, due to their alleged links with the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party, known by the Turkish acronym PKK.

Mr. Erdogan was an early supporter of the Free Syrian Army, but as the conflict progressed and the rebellion was taken over by radical Islamists, Turkey shifted its support to those groups, including Ahrar al-Sham and Faylaq Al-Sham. Ankara did this with the hope of replacing the Alawite Assad regime with a Sunni-led government, which would owe Turkey its allegiance.

Turkey hosted Syrian political dissidents in the earliest stages of the rebellion and provided the Free Syrian Army with a secure base of operations within Turkey. Arms from Saudi Arabia and Qatar were flown into Turkey en masse and distributed to rebel groups across the border. As the conflict escalated and militant Islamist groups, including ISIS and Jabhat Al-Nusra, became the most powerful rebel factions, Turkey continued facilitating the flow of arms, cash and recruits across its border.

Turkish involvement in Syria has hurt its relationships with the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. has often seen Turkey's involvement as hampering the war against ISIS. Turkish support for the rebellion is contrary to Russia's actions to preserve the Assad regime, and the downing of a Russian warplane by the Turkish military in August 2015 saw the nadir of an already troubled relationship. Turkey has also been accused by international media as well as by the Russian government of supporting various terrorist groups, including ISIS. This has hurt its international reputation as a responsible steward of regional stability.

Mr. Erdogan continued to pursue regime change in Syria long after it had become clear that the U.S. wouldn't intervene to topple Mr. Assad. However, when Aleppo fell to regime forces in December, Turkey co-sponsored with Russia a cease-fire, which was signed Dec. 30.

Now Turkey's main priority is to suppress Kurdish autonomy in Syria. The Turks are using the cease-fire to marginalize the Kurds by escalating their military assault on Kurdish positions. On the same day the cease-fire went into effect, the Kurdish media reported that Turkish military and Turkish-backed Islamist rebels were attacking Kurdish towns and militia security offices.

The Assad regime is also putting pressure on the Kurds and insisting they acknowledge the regime's authority. In a Dec. 27 meeting with Kurdish representatives, the regime offered support as long as the Kurds vowed to back Assad in upcoming elections. The regime also demanded that the Kurds abandon their pursuit of a federal system for Syria and hoist the Syrian flag over government buildings and offices.

During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump argued that we should be "arming" Kurdish fighters. "They have proven to be the best fighters, they have proven to be the most loyal to us," he said. Now under pressure from all sides, Syrian Kurds are counting on Mr. Trump to follow through.

Yet political support is more crucial than arms. The Trump administration should make clear that its support for the Kurds extends beyond the fight with ISIS. He should affirm their right to self-directed political and civil representation in Syria. The best way to start is by insisting that the Syrian Kurds have a seat at the table in negotiating an end to the Syrian civil war.

The U.S. has a mixed record with arming the Kurds and encouraging their ambitions for self-determination. American support has been instrumental in the success of the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq, but Washington has also abandoned the Iraqi Kurds many times.

If the new American president stands firm, the State Department will have to balance U.S. support for Syrian Kurds with assurances to Turkey that the PKK will not be empowered. Fully siding with Turkey will go down as another cynical betrayal.

Ash Carter Says Putin Is Making It Harder for U.S. to Work With Russia; Outgoing defense secretary's appraisal of Moscow's behavior in Syria and beyond stands in contrast with President-elect Trump's

WASHINGTON—ussia has done nothing to help defeat Islamic State forces in Syria and has adopted a strategy of "explicitly thwarting the U.S." elsewhere, outgoing Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Carter, who has a long history of working with Russian officials over the course of his career, said Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to blunt American influence have been increasing and are making it harder to find areas in which Washington and Moscow can work together.

"I think it is something that has grown steadily under Putin's leadership," he said. "It seems to be part of his self-conception. And one of the ways he defines the success of his policy is not by results on the ground but the level of the discomfort he can create in the rest of the world and show to his people as the point of his policy."

He added, "That's what makes it so difficult to build a bridge" to Russia's leaders.

Mr. Carter, who will leave his Pentagon office as President-elect Donald Trump takes over later this month, said he wasn't attempting to advise the incoming administration. But his appraisal of Russian behavior, in Syria and beyond, stands in stark contrast with the analysis Mr. Trump and some of his advisers have offered of Russia generally and Mr. Putin specifically.

Mr. Trump has said he admires Mr. Putin as a leader, has said he would like a better relationship with Russia in general, and has specifically cited Russia as a potential ally in defeating Islamic State forces.

But Mr. Carter bluntly said the Russian military, as it has taken on an increasingly assertive role in shoring up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in recent months, has been unhelpful in the fight against Islamic State forces, also known by the acronym ISIL.

"They haven't done anything to fight ISIL," he said. "They've been fighting the moderate opposition along with the Syrian government. Everything they've done has been wrong headed and completely the obverse of what they said they were going to do."

Russian leaders also haven't fulfilled their promise to use their foothold in Syria to "facilitate a transition" away from the Assad regime to a broader government that includes the moderate opposition to Mr. Assad, Mr. Carter said.

"They haven't done that," he said. "They haven't facilitated that transition. They've just doubled down on the civil war."

As Mr. Carter's comments suggest, Russia has emerged as the national-security issue on which the contrast between the outgoing Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration is most striking. His remarks come as leaders from Mr. Trump's own Republican Party have begun hearings to examine Russian hacking operations allegedly designed to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump, unlike others in the GOP, has been dismissive of intelligence community assessments of Russia's covert interference in the election process.

Asked whether the incoming president and his team are taking an overly rosy view of the role Russia is playing in Syria, Mr. Carter replied: "I can't speak for them, and they'll have to establish their own set of views on that matter. But I've been working on and with Russia for a quarter-century now since the end of the Cold War."

Mr. Carter said he has tried to adopt a policy of being "strong and balanced" with Russia and being willing to work with the Kremlin when that is possible. And he cited the threats from North Korea and Iran as two areas where that has happened.

He did encourage the new Congress and administration to continue funding programs designed to help European allies—articularly on the eastern edge of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—efend against potential Russian interference.

"I am confident that is a necessary thing to do, and we have to continue to invest in it," he said. "We'll have to show the leadership in Europe that keeps NATO together, because one of the Russian objectives is to split off or try to peel off individual members of the alliance. It's always been an objective, it remains an objective."

Despite what he described as a lack of Russian help combating Islamic State, Mr. Carter said he was optimistic that the U.S. and its allies are prevailing in the effort to defeat the extremist group's forces. The key to prevailing, he said, is to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqaa, which Islamic State forces claim as the capital of their self-proclaimed caliphate.

"I'm confident that's the right path, and that those two cities will fall," he said. "And that will go a considerable distance toward eliminating the fact of an Islamic state based on ISIL's ideology in Iraq and Syria—ut also the idea that such a thing has a future and will be tolerated."

Belgium's Botched Hunt for  ISIS  Cell --- Secret parliamentary report offers new details on how badly police erred in unmasking terrorists before Paris and Brussels attacks

BRUSSELS -- Belgian police had numerous chances to unmask the Islamic State terror cell that later carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks, according to a confidential report prepared for Belgium's Parliament. They muffed every one.

In early 2015, Brussels police stopped a car driven by Brahim Abdeslam, later one of the Paris attackers, and arrested him for drug possession. At the time, Brahim was on a terror watch list. He carried a booklet about "parental consent for the Jihad." Police found a USB thumb drive hidden behind his car radio.

He was let go after brief questioning. Authorities failed to analyze the thumb drive or other electronics seized after the drug stop from an apartment Brahim shared with his younger brother, also involved in the attacks, Salah Abdeslam. Another unnoticed detail: The email address the suspect supplied, s_orry@hotmail.com, was a fake.

The incident, details of which haven't been previously reported, is outlined in the parliamentary report prepared by Comite P, a watchdog agency of former police and judicial officials auditing the work of Belgian police in the wake of the attacks. The 82-page report, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, was finalized in September and hasn't been made public.

European police have foiled many would-be terrorists in recent years. In many of the major attacks that did occur, the terrorists' radical leanings were well known to police, who failed to halt them in time.

German authorities have faced similar criticism for failing to neutralize the suspect in December's Berlin truck attack. The Tunisian immigrant, killed in a shootout in Milan days after the attack, was known to have radical ties and had been ordered to be deported. On Thursday, Germany said top federal and regional security officials met seven times to discuss the potential danger posed by the immigrant before the attack but failed to stop him.

The Belgian report reveals that police had information before the Paris and Brussels attacks that showed the Abdeslam brothers had relationships with other terror suspects; that Brahim wasn't questioned after interactions with law enforcement even though he was on a terror watch list; and that police didn't follow up when Salah changed his social-media profile picture to the ISIS flag.

The Comite P report, along with other documents and interviews with Belgian officials, reveals the extent to which Belgian authorities bungled the investigation of the ISIS cell by ignoring informant tips, failing to heed alerts from other countries and poorly coordinating law-enforcement branches.

Members of the ISIS cell also left a financial trail, including wire transfers and rental-car transactions. Belgium's antiterror finance investigators were able to reconstruct some of these only after the fact.

Belgian police, for their part, say they are chronically underfunded and overworked.

Nine months after the drug arrest, Brahim, 31 years old, was dead, one of the suicide attackers who killed 130 in the November 2015 Paris attacks. His brother Salah, a key logistics coordinator who had transported many of the Paris terrorists on their journeys from Syria, was on the run, caught in March just before the Brussels attacks that left 32 dead.

Salah, now 27, is awaiting trial in France. He is without a lawyer after his representation dropped his case in October.

The confidential report is part of a broader inquiry by the Belgian Parliament that includes extensive witness testimony. A spokeswoman for Comite P confirmed the committee wrote the report but declined to comment further. The Belgian newspaper De Tijd has reported some elements of the report.

The chief federal prosecutor, Frederic Leeuw, accused Comite P of "tunnel vision" by using hindsight to focus on only a few suspects, saying police had dozens of cases open at the time.

In December testimony before Parliament, he said officials lacked enough evidence before the attacks to arrest the Abdeslams or even get legal permission for wiretaps. "Today we all know what they've done, but at the time there was a box with many missing puzzle pieces."

Federal police dismissed the importance of Brahim Abdeslam's Jihad booklet by explaining that the document "urges the youngster to respect his parents when they oppose the Jihad," according to the Comite P report.

Belgian officials said they have improved coordination and beefed up antiterror funding by 400 million euros, or about $418 million.

Lt. Gen. Eddy Testelmans, head of Belgium's foreign intelligence service, said the country is sharing information more efficiently and investing in communications and cybersecurity.

Belgium's state of alert remains at the second-highest level and soldiers continue to be deployed on the streets. Police have arrested dozens of suspects since March, some charged with plotting other attacks.

The Comite P report and other documents expose the Belgian security apparatus as underfunded and dysfunctional. Law-enforcement bodies, with no single chain of command, are divided into various fiefs split along linguistic lines -- Dutch in the north and French in the south, with a bilingual Brussels divided among overlapping zones.

The Federal police, which have a counterterrorism unit, rely on obsolete, 1985-era vintage computer systems, federal police chief Catherine De Bolle testified in October.

What should be a simple check to see if a suspect has known terror links requires sifting through 20 different databases.

"We need a hit/no-hit system at the national level," the Comite P chief wrote to Parliament in the letter accompanying the report.

Such a system is being set up, Belgian officials said, but won't be fully operational for two to three years.

The Abdeslam brothers were two of five siblings, raised in Molenbeek, a heavily Muslim section of Brussels. Brahim was described by neighbors as quiet, while Salah was friendly and helpful. Both men were born in Brussels, but were French citizens of Moroccan heritage.

Until a few weeks before the attacks, the brothers co-owned a scruffy Molenbeek bar. The brothers sold the bar after local authorities closed it down on suspicion that drugs were being sold and consumed there.

Both brothers had earlier brushes with the law. According to the Comite P report, Brahim was involved in 40 offenses starting at age 15, including robbery, weapons possession and drugs. Salah's 12 offenses included a 2010 break-in at a parking garage, for which he served a month in prison.

What is significant about that crime is the person he was caught with: Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a neighborhood friend who later helped lead the Paris attacks and died in a shootout with French police.

Police have described Mr. Abaaoud, a Belgian who went to fight with ISIS in Syria, as the central player in the Brussels ISIS cell. He is believed to have coordinated several plots in Europe, including a May 2014 attack on the Jewish Museum in Brussels, which killed four people. Before the Paris attacks he was among the most wanted ISIS operatives in Europe.

Police had at least two tips linking the Abdeslams to Mr. Abaaoud and to terrorism. The first, in July 2014, came from a Belgian counterterror policewoman of Moroccan descent who was in touch with a neighbor of the Abdeslam family, according to Comite P.

She reported that the brothers were getting radicalized, were in touch with Mr. Abaaoud and were planning something "irreversible." Another counterterror police officer, assigned to check out the tip, concluded that at least one of the brothers was "radicalized and wanted to go to Syria, because his mother took his passport away."

However, the officer never shared the information with other police units, because he was uncertain which of the brothers the source was talking about and didn't want to incriminate the wrong one, according to Comite P.

The second tip linking the Abdeslams to Mr. Abaaoud came in January 2015, shortly after a police raid and shootout foiled a plot in the eastern Belgian town of Verviers. The plot again had been coordinated by Mr. Abaaoud, at that point a highly sought-after terror suspect.

An informant told police that Salah was a friend of Mr. Abaaoud's and that the two had recently been in touch several times, according to Comite P. The informant, who claimed to have talked to Salah, said that his brother Brahim was on his way to Syria, that Salah was ready to follow soon and that Salah said "the brothers in Syria need help."

The tip seemed solid: Brahim had boarded a flight to Turkey two days before the informant's report, according to Comite P. Local police found that he had returned to Belgium as of Feb. 9, and he was put on a terror watch list.

Police asked Salah to come in for questioning, according to Comite P. When he did, three weeks later, he admitted being friends with Mr. Abaaoud but defended his old burglary partner, saying: "Other than the Jihad, he is a good person."

Salah claimed he hadn't been in touch with Mr. Abaaoud for three years and said he didn't support ISIS. He was let go, the report said.

Electronics belonging to the brothers the police seized after the traffic stop -- a mobile phone, four computers, two Sim cards and three thumb drives, including the one found behind the car's radio -- could have shown some of these statements to be lies. But they sat untouched until after the Paris attacks.

When police finally examined the electronics and cellphone records, they showed that both brothers had been in touch with people known for their radical or terrorist ties. Brahim was communicating with Mohamed Abrini, known as the "man in the hat" seen in surveillance footage of the three Brussels airport bombers, and who now is in custody in Belgium awaiting trial on terrorism charges.

The failure to analyze the electronics was due largely to manpower shortages at the counterterror police, and the pressure of other priorities, the Comite P report said.

The federal prosecutors' office repeatedly asked for more to be done with the Abdeslams' case in early 2015, but the counterterror police never assigned a dedicated investigator, saying there was a lack of resources.

Instead, they drafted so-called contextualization reports, intended to unearth the likelihood of terrorism links for a suspect, according to Comite P.

Comite P said the reports concluded there were "no elements" to suggest the brothers were radicalizing and in touch with known terror suspects.

A judge closed the brothers' case files in June 2015, but kept them in the European police database with a request for a "discreet check" and an alert to Belgium when they crossed borders.

This type of alert, which didn't specifically flag Salah as radicalized, led to a major blunder hours after the Paris attacks: French traffic police stopped Salah as he was fleeing back to Brussels but let him pass. Two hours later, Belgian authorities told French police he was actually on a terror watch list, but it was too late, according to a French parliamentary probe concluded this summer. Salah managed to hide for another four months in Brussels.

In the months preceding the Paris attacks, other movements by Salah in Europe were flagged, but to no avail: He was tracked in Greece on Aug. 5, boarding a ferry to Italy with another suspect, according to Comite P. Then, on Sept. 9, Salah was checked by Austrian police when traveling from Hungary with two men -- who turned out to be Brussels attackers -- in a rented Mercedes. They claimed to be headed to Vienna for vacation.

Although Belgian authorities received alerts, they were ignored. The report said local police believed the case was being handled by federal authorities, while federal police considered the case closed.

In July 2015, an unnamed partner country provided intelligence suggesting Mr. Abaaoud was returning to Europe with dozens of foreign fighters to mount attacks in several major cities, according to Comite P.

The federal police orally told the prosecutor about the tip but didn't share it more broadly, the report said, because they treated it as classified.

Meanwhile, Brahim's brushes with the law continued -- in July, he was found with a knife in a crashed car -- but the incidents weren't properly cross-referenced to his terrorism file.

In August, Brahim checked in at Brussels airport for a 5:10 a.m. flight to Morocco. Federal authorities should have been alerted by border police, but no report was made.

Finally, in late October, three weeks before the Paris attacks, a Belgian terror-threat analysis body detected that Salah had changed his social-media profile picture to an ISIS flag. It alerted federal police. Nothing was done with that information; the police said the case had been closed.

BRUSSELS—elgian police had numerous chances to unmask the Islamic State terror cell that later carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks, according to a confidential report prepared for Belgium's Parliament. They muffed every one.

In early 2015, Brussels police stopped a car driven by Brahim Abdeslam, later one of the Paris attackers, and arrested him for drug possession. At the time, Brahim was on a terror watch list. He carried a booklet about "parental consent for the Jihad." Police found a USB thumb drive hidden behind his car radio.

He was let go after brief questioning. Authorities failed to analyze the thumb drive or other electronics seized after the drug stop from an apartment Brahim shared with his younger brother, also involved in the attacks, Salah Abdeslam. Another unnoticed detail: The email address the suspect supplied, s_orry@hotmail.com, was a fake.

The incident, details of which haven't been previously reported, is outlined in the parliamentary report prepared by Comité, a watchdog agency of former police and judicial officials auditing the work of Belgian police in the wake of the twin attacks. The 82-page report, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, was finalized in September and hasn't been made public.

European police have foiled many would-be terrorists in recent years. In many of the major attacks that did occur, the terrorists' radical leanings were well known to police, who failed to halt them in time.

German authorities have faced similar criticism for failing to neutralize the suspect in December's Berlin truck attack. The Tunisian immigrant, killed in a shootout in Milan days after the attack, was known to have radical ties and had been ordered to be deported. On Thursday, Germany said top federal and regional security officials met seven times to discuss the potential danger posed by the immigrant before the attack but failed to stop him.

The Belgian report reveals that police had information before the Paris and Brussels attacks that showed the Abdeslam brothers had relationships with other terror suspects; that Brahim wasn't questioned after multiple interactions with law enforcement even though he was on a terror watch list; and that police didn't follow up when Salah changed his social-media profile picture to the ISIS flag.

The Comité report, along with other official documents and interviews with Belgian officials, reveals the extent to which Belgian authorities bungled the investigation of the \b ISIS\b0  cell by ignoring informant tips, failing to heed alerts from other countries and poorly coordinating between law-enforcement branches.

Members of the ISIS cell also left a financial trail, including wire transfers and rental-car transactions. Belgium's antiterror finance investigators were able to reconstruct some of these only after the fact.

Belgian police, for their part, say they are chronically underfunded and overworked.

Nine months after the drug arrest, Brahim, 31 years old, was dead, one of the suicide attackers who killed 130 in the November 2015 Paris attacks. His brother Salah, a key logistics coordinator who had transported many of the Paris terrorists on their journeys from Syria, was on the run, caught in March just before the Brussels attacks that left 32 dead.

Salah, now 27, is being held in France awaiting trial. He is without a lawyer after his representation dropped his case in October. The French prosecutor said Salah admitted he wanted to blow himself up during the attacks but then changed his mind.

The confidential report is part of a broader inquiry by the Belgian Parliament that includes extensive witness testimony. A spokeswoman for Comité confirmed the committee wrote the report but declined to comment further. The Belgian newspaper De Tijd has reported some elements of the report.

The chief federal prosecutor, Frederic Leeuw, accused Comité of "tunnel vision" by using hindsight to focus on only a few suspects, saying police had dozens of cases open at the time. In December testimony before Parliament, he said officials lacked enough evidence before the attacks to arrest the Abdeslams or even get legal permission for wiretaps. "Today we all know what they've done, but at the time there was a box with many missing puzzle pieces."

Federal police dismissed the importance of Brahim's Jihad booklet by explaining that the document "urges the youngster to respect his parents when they oppose the Jihad," according to the Comité report.

Belgian officials said they have improved coordination and beefed up antiterror funding by €00 million, or about $418 million. Lt. Gen. Eddy Testelmans, head of Belgium's foreign intelligence service, said the country is sharing information more efficiently and investing in communications and cybersecurity.

Belgium's state of alert remains at the second-highest level and soldiers continue to be deployed on the streets. Police have arrested dozens of suspects since March, some charged with plotting other attacks.

The Comité report and other documents expose the Belgian security apparatus as underfunded and dysfunctional. Law-enforcement bodies, with no single chain of command, are divided into various fiefs split along linguistic lines—utch in the north and French in the south, with a bilingual Brussels divided among overlapping zones.

The Federal police, which have a counterterrorism unit, rely on obsolete, 1985-era vintage computer systems, federal police chief Catherine De Bolle testified in October.

What should be a simple check to see if a suspect has known terror links requires sifting through 20 different databases. "We need a hit/no-hit system at the national level," the Comité chief wrote to Parliament in the letter accompanying the report. Such a system is being set up, Belgian officials said, but won't be fully operational for two to three years.

Unlike their counterparts in the U.S., Belgian officials haven't focused on financial intelligence to prevent terrorist plots.

Law enforcement before the Paris and Brussels attacks didn't contact the main Belgian counterterror finance agency, the Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, to see if the Abdeslams and others who turned out to be in the Brussels-based ISIS cell had any unusual money transactions, according to Philippe de Koster, the agency's director.

Authorities are still trying to reconstruct some elements of the ISIS cell's financial footprint, said Mr. de Koster, who added that there is now enhanced cooperation.

The Abdeslam brothers were two of five siblings, raised in Molenbeek, a heavily Muslim section of Brussels. Brahim was described by neighbors as quiet, while Salah was friendly and helpful. Both men were born in Brussels, but were French citizens of Moroccan heritage.

Until a few weeks before the attacks, the brothers co-owned a scruffy Molenbeek bar. The brothers sold the bar after local authorities closed it down on suspicion that drugs were being sold and consumed there.

Both brothers had earlier brushes with the law. According to the Comité report, Brahim was involved in 40 offenses starting at age 15, including robbery, weapons possession and drugs. Salah's 12 offenses included a 2010 break-in at a parking garage, for which he served a month in prison.

What is significant about that crime is the person he was caught with: Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a neighborhood friend who later helped lead the Paris attacks and died in a shootout with French police.

Police have described Mr. Abaaoud, a Belgian who went to fight with ISIS in Syria, as the central player in the Brussels ISIS cell. He is believed to have coordinated several plots in Europe, including a May 2014 attack on the Jewish Museum in Brussels, which killed four people. Before the Paris attacks he was among the most wanted ISIS operatives in Europe.

Police had at least two tips linking the Abdeslams to Mr. Abaaoud and to terrorism. The first, in July 2014, came from a Belgian counterterror policewoman of Moroccan descent who was in touch with a neighbor of the Abdeslam family, according to Comité.

She reported that the brothers were getting radicalized, were in touch with Mr. Abaaoud and were planning something "irreversible." Another counterterror police officer, assigned to check out the tip, concluded that at least one of the brothers was "radicalized and wanted to go to Syria, because his mother took his passport away."

However, the officer never shared the information with other police units, because he was uncertain which of the brothers the source was talking about and didn't want to incriminate the wrong one, according to Comité.

The second tip linking the Abdeslams to Mr. Abaaoud came in January 2015, shortly after a police raid and shootout foiled a plot in the eastern Belgian town of Verviers. The plot again had been coordinated by Mr. Abaaoud, at that point a highly sought-after terror suspect.

An informant told police that Salah was a friend of Mr. Abaaoud's and that the two had recently been in touch several times, according to Comité. The informant, who claimed to have talked to Salah, said that his brother Brahim was on his way to Syria, that Salah was ready to follow soon and that Salah said "the brothers in Syria need help."

The tip seemed solid: Brahim had boarded a flight to Turkey two days before the informant's report, according to Comité. Local police found that he had returned to Belgium as of Feb. 9, and he was put on a terror watch list.

Police asked Salah to come in for questioning, according to Comité. When he did, three weeks later, he admitted being friends with Mr. Abaaoud but defended his old burglary partner, saying: "Other than the Jihad, he is a good person."

Salah claimed he hadn't been in touch with Mr. Abaaoud for three years and said he didn't support ISIS. He was let go, the report said.

Electronics belonging to the brothers the police seized after the traffic stop— mobile phone, four computers, two Sim cards and three thumb drives, including the one found hidden behind the car's radio—ould have shown some of these statements to be lies. But they sat untouched by police until after the Paris attacks.

When police finally examined the electronics and cellphone records, they showed that both brothers had been in touch with people known for their radical or terrorist ties. Brahim was communicating with Mohamed Abrini, known as the "man in the hat" seen in surveillance footage of the three Brussels airport bombers, and who now is in custody in Belgium awaiting trial on terrorism charges.

Mr. Abrini's lawyer declined to comment. Two bombers were killed in the attack, and Belgian prosecutors said Mr. Abrini admitted to being the third.

The failure to analyze the electronics was due largely to manpower shortages at the counterterror police, and the pressure of other investigation priorities, the Comité report said.

The federal prosecutors' office repeatedly asked for more to be done with the Abdeslams' case in early 2015, but the counterterror police never assigned a dedicated investigator, saying there was a lack of resources.

Instead, they drafted so-called contextualization reports, intended to unearth the likelihood of terrorism links for a suspect, according to Comité. These reports are "a compilation of information available at a certain point, about the general context and the main actors," according to the watchdog.

Comité said the reports concluded there were "no elements" to suggest the brothers were radicalizing and in touch with known terror suspects.

A judge closed the brothers' case files in June 2015, but kept their names in the European police database with a request for a "discreet check" and an alert to Belgian authorities whenever they crossed a border.

This type of alert, which didn't specifically flag Salah as radicalized, led to a major blunder hours after the Paris attacks: French traffic police stopped Salah as he was fleeing back to Brussels but let him pass. Two hours later, Belgian authorities told French police he was actually on a terror watch list, but it was too late, according to a French parliamentary probe concluded this summer. Salah managed to hide for another four months in Brussels.

In the months preceding the Paris attacks, other movements by Salah throughout Europe were flagged, but to no avail: He was tracked in Greece on Aug. 5, boarding a ferry to Italy with another suspect, according to Comité. Then, on Sept. 9, Salah was checked by Austrian police when traveling from Hungary with two men—ho turned out to be Brussels attackers—n a rented Mercedes. They claimed to be headed to Vienna for vacation.

Although Belgian authorities received alerts in both cases, they were ignored. The report said local police believed the case was being handled by federal authorities, while federal police considered the case closed.

In July 2015, an unnamed partner country provided intelligence suggesting Mr. Abaaoud was returning to Europe with dozens of foreign fighters to mount attacks in several major cities, according to Comité.

The federal police orally told the prosecutor about the tip but didn't share it more broadly, the report said, because they treated the information as classified.

Meanwhile, Brahim's brushes with the law continued—n July, he was found with a knife in a crashed car—ut the incidents weren't properly cross-referenced to his terrorism file.

In August, Brahim checked in at Brussels airport for a 5:10 a.m. flight to Morocco. Federal authorities should have been alerted by border police, but no report was made.

Finally, in late October, three weeks before the Paris attacks, a Belgian terror-threat analysis body detected that Salah had changed his social-media profile picture to an ISIS flag. It alerted federal police. Nothing was done with that information; the police said the case had been closed.

Wonder Land: Donald Trump's Opportunity With Black Americans

A list of keyword search terms for the omnipresent Donald Trump likely would include: tweet, Putin, transition, China, Carrier, GM, ISIS, taxes, Mexico, immigrants, nativist and white.

One search term would not show up on any list: black Americans.

Black Americans appear -- as a political issue -- on every presidential candidate's must-do list. But after the voting stops, they generally drop down or off the list. Four years later, the same people are living in the same neighborhoods with the same disordered schools and the same dim prospects for economic advancement.

Conventional wisdom now holds that Donald Trump is president because he identified the angry white counterparts of black voters who have watched the world pass them by election after election.

Maybe black voters are angry, too. And maybe with Donald Trump, of all people, they'll get some political respect that matters.

In September, Mr. Trump visited a private charter school, the Cleveland Arts and Social Sciences Academy, in one of that city's toughest neighborhoods.

Why take the time? Commentary at the time noted that Mr. Trump's support in polls among Ohio's blacks was about zero. The campaign's real targets were white, blue-collar voters in places like Parma on Cleveland's west side.

Still, Mr. Trump gave a quiet speech to a small audience at that Cleveland charter about the "ladder to success."

"I define that," he said, "as a great education and a great job." He added: "You cannot have prosperity without safety. This is the new civil rights agenda of our time."

Again, why try? So strong is black support for the Democratic Party -- well over 80% in every presidential election since 1964 -- that it has become a subject of study among political scientists who describe the black vote as "captured."

One plausible explanation for this loyalty is that black Americans vote their interests. Franklin Roosevelt offered economic hope in the 1930s, and Lyndon Johnson passed the civil rights acts in the '60s. Republicans got dropped from blacks' voting calculations, which haven't changed in 50 years.

It's hard to know where Mr. Trump gets his political ideas, but worth noting is that he recruited former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as energy secretary.

Recall that in July 2015, when running for the GOP nomination, Mr. Perry gave an extraordinary speech imploring his party to campaign for the black vote and asking black voters to recognize how little they were getting now for their support of Democrats. "Why is it today," he asked, "so many black families feel left behind?" A year later, Donald Trump was asking the same question.

Barack Obama will deliver his farewell speech in homicidal Chicago next week. The irony is hardly worth noting, and Mr. Obama will make the best case for himself. Several things, though, deserve mention before his departure.

For starters, urban blacks aren't particularly happy about how things worked out with the Obama presidency. Reporting done on this has turned up disappointment with their progress.

In the eight years of the Obama presidency, all the familiar inner-city problems -- unemployment, violence, underachievement -- somehow got transferred to the issue of the police, as if the cops invented poverty and immobility in Chicago, Baltimore or Ferguson, Mo.

Less noticed, but as telling, is how much time the Obama departments of justice and labor spent filing lawsuits based on disparate-impact theory, which holds that discrimination is discoverable using arcane statistical analyses of housing patterns or lending practices.

If the party of Roosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson is raising up black America with statistics a half-century after the civil rights acts, it has run out of ideas on the way forward.

Black turnout for Hillary Clinton was down, but not just because she wasn't Mr. Obama. It was, for example, because her proposals for their schools -- more federal spending on building upgrades and teacher training -- were familiar and for many of them, failed.

Could Donald Trump be the next FDR for black Americans? Choke down that gulp. Early Roosevelt was one thing -- a president offering work. So is this one.

Restoring economic growth is the baseline. But for poor blacks it isn't enough. Growth has passed over them before. Also needed is deliverance on two Trump promises that precede real jobs: "great education" and "safety."

The potential in education with nominee Betsy DeVos is directly proportional to her opposition on charters and choice from the tongs defending the schools status quo.

Less noticed is Ben Carson. This isn't just another housing secretary. The Carson mission, made clear in his primary campaign, is to challenge the idea that "structural racism" explains the dead end on urban progress.

It's a heavy lift. Which is why presidencies drop it. These are the early days of a new presidency when hope is no sin. The expectation here is that Donald Trump meant what he said at that charter school in Cleveland.

German Officials Met Seven Times to Discuss Berlin Attacker Before Assault; But authorities concluded that Anis Amri didn't pose an acute risk and that they didn't have enough evidence to hold up in court, officials testify

DÜSELDORF, Germany—op federal and regional security officials met seven times to discuss the potential danger posed by Tunisian migrant Anis Amri in the year before he attacked a Berlin Christmas market, the latest revelation in a string of mishaps that failed to prevent the attack.             

The new details, disclosed by security officials at a regional parliamentary hearing Thursday, suggest that German security and intelligence authorities miscalculated the immediate threat that Amri presented. Despite extensive surveillance, efforts to detain him repeatedly faltered because police and prosecutors believed they didn't have evidence that would stand up in court, the officials said.                           

The emerging affair is raising questions about the ability of Germany, which was struck four times by Islamist terrorists last year, to prevent future attacks. It is also increasing pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel amid accusations that her decision to accept hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim migrants in 2015 might have put the country at risk.                           

"Does one have to sit in a truck before the state can act?" Social Democrat Andreas Bialas asked at one point in the nearly five-hour hearing in the parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia, echoing the public's stupefaction at the series of revelations about why the state failed to stop Amri despite all it knew about him.              

A recent Insa poll conducted for the German daily Bild found just under a fifth of those surveyed trusted Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats to protect the country from further attacks; Other German parties scored even lower. Germany's interior minister, meanwhile, proposed this week revamping Germany's decentralized security apparatus to close the gaps exposed by the Berlin attack.              

"Nobody understands how a known extremist was able to walk around freely in this country," Gregor Golland, a regional lawmaker from the Christian Democratic Union, said before questioning security officials Thursday.             

The illegal Tunisian immigrant—is asylum request was rejected in June 2016—ammed a truck into Christmas market in central Berlin on Dec. 19, leaving 12 people dead and dozens more injured. He escaped after German police first arrested the wrong man and then missed crucial evidence identifying Amri in a first sweep of the truck. Amri trekked across Europe and was eventually shot by Italian police four days later.             

                 Ralf Jäer, interior minister for North Rhine-Westphalia—here Amri spent his first months in Germany and first prompted authorities' alarm—aid officials had done everything they could legally do to pre-empt an attack.             

"I think security authorities went to the maximum limit of our state of law. They did everything they could and were allowed to do," he said.             

The new details showed that Amri tricked German authorities from the moment he entered the country in the summer of 2015, taking advantage of the administrative chaos amid a surge of asylum seekers that year and the lack of central database about the new arrivals to register himself across different states, using 14 different identities, sometimes leaving just a day between registrations.             

Authorities were first alerted to his radical Islamist tendencies in October that year. A roommate of Amri warned authorities that he had spotted photos on Amri's cellphone showing people dressed in black and carrying weapons. An undercover agent infiltrated in the radical Islamist scene also reported Amri appeared to be serving as a messenger for a local Islamist network, officials said.             

In December 2015, having started to monitor him, authorities became aware that Amri had been expressing the desire to stage an attack in Germany and had searched online for instructions about how to build bombs. They were also tipped off that he was planning a robbery in Berlin to fund the purchase of weapons.             

Shortly thereafter, state and federal security officials gathered for the first time to discuss his case. In February, Amri was placed on a list of dangerous radical Islamists. That month alone, officials from the joint counterterrorism center in Berlin, an umbrella body for 40 federal and regional security agencies, discussed Amri's case at three separate meetings.              

Four more meetings follow in April, in June and a last one in November, a month before the attack. It isn't clear whether all the meetings were held to talk exclusively Amri or whether his was one of several cases discussed.             

Still, in what turned out to be a misjudgment, authorities concluded Amri didn't pose an acute risk, officials testified Thursday.             

Undercover agents learned in February that Amri had moved to Berlin and was, again, speaking about wanting to die in the name of Allah and seeking other people to help him plan and conduct an attack.             

On the back of this latest information, federal prosecutors opened an fresh undercover investigation, monitoring his communications for six months through September. But after this failed to yield actionable evidence, investigators suspended their electronic surveillance.              

As recently as July, authorities discussed targeting Amri with a new legal provision that fast-tracks the deportation of someone seen as a particular terror risk. In a discussion involving a representative from the general prosecutor's office, they decided against using the measure because they didn't believe they could prove in court that Amri presented an acute danger, state Interior Ministry official Burkhard Schnieder said.             

In any case, officials said, a deportation effort using that legal provision in the summer wouldn't have worked because Tunisian officials only confirmed Amri's status as a Tunisian citizen in October.             

In September and October last year, police in North Rhine-Westphalia received tips from Tunisian and Moroccan security agencies that Amri supported Islamic State, had contact with Islamic State sympathizers in Berlin, and "wanted to carry out a project" in Germany, Dieter Schümann, head of North Rhine-Westphalia's criminal investigative agency LKA told lawmakers.             

But the warnings were too abstract to justify an arrest, he added. On a scale of one to eight, with one representing the strongest risk, Amri ranked five, Mr. Schümann said.              

German security officials use the scale, which is based on an analysis of evidence against a suspect, to assess the threat posed by a suspect. But because authorities never had proof that he was putting in motion any intent or plan to attack, Amri didn't register a higher score.             

In other words, what appeared like a mountain of evidence documenting Amri's intention, officials said, didn't satisfy German courts' requirements to detain him on suspicion of planning an attack or even being a passive member of a foreign terrorist organization— criminal offense under German law.              

"What authorities knew was hearsay. That isn't enough to arrest someone. You need to convince a judge," Mr. Jäer said. He said many of the 548 potentially dangerous radical Islamists on German authorities' official list of potential attackers have been known "to make such threats or even just brag about wanting to do an attack" without acting on them.

Trump and Black Americans; FDR offered the hope of prosperity. Can the new president do the same?

Restoring economic growth is the baseline. But for poor blacks it isn't enough. Growth has passed over them before. Also needed is deliverance on two Trump promises that precede real jobs: "great education" and "safety."

The potential in education with nominee Betsy DeVos is directly proportional to her opposition on charters and choice from the tongs defending the schools status quo.

Less noticed is Ben Carson. This isn't just another housing secretary. The Carson mission, made clear in his primary campaign, is to challenge the idea that "structural racism" explains the dead end on urban progress.

It's a heavy lift. Which is why presidencies drop it. These are the early days of a new presidency when hope is no sin. The expectation here is that Donald Trump meant what he said at that charter school in Cleveland.

Tunisian Migrant Under Investigation in Berlin Christmas Market Attack; Prosecutors say 26-year-old man was taken into custody in connection with a separate probe

BERLIN—erman federal prosecutors said Wednesday they were investigating a second Tunisian migrant for possible involvement in last month's deadly Christmas market attack in Berlin.

There wasn't enough evidence to detain the unnamed 26-year-old migrant for complicity in the attack, but he was taken into custody Tuesday in connection with a separate investigation, said Frauke Köler, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office.

Anis Amri, the Tunisian man who killed 12 people when he rammed a stolen truck into a crowded Berlin Christmas market on December 19, was shot dead four days later by Italian police near Milan.

The attack, the most serious in recent German history, and the fact that Amri had long been known to the authorities as a criminal and Islamist extremist have raised questions about the preparedness of German authorities and the country's vulnerability to further attacks.

Investigators had found that Amri and the detained man had met on the night before the attack in a restaurant in Berlin's Mitte district and spoken at length, Ms. Köler said.

"This raised the suspicion that the 26 year old might have been involved in the crime or at least have known of the plans," she said.

German investigators have been trying to establish whether Amri had any accomplices in carrying out the attack or in making his escape from the country.

In late December, prosecutors had briefly detained another Tunisian they believed might be connected to the attack but they released him as it turned out to be the wrong person.

Tuesday's arrest is the latest instance of how police and prosecutors, in a tug of war with judges, have sought alternative grounds to detain possibly dangerous individuals whenever they lacked firm evidence they were planning attacks.

In November, authorities briefly detained an asylum seeker suspected of plotting an attack for Islamic State, or ISIS, here but a federal judge ruled he couldn't be kept for lack of evidence. Prosecutors in Berlin then had him arrested on suspicion of forging documents.

In this case, the Berlin state prosecutor's office said the 26-year-old was under investigation for fraud. He is suspected of using forged identities in different states to illegally collect benefits set aside for asylum seekers. He arrived in Germany in 2014, according to a spokesman for the Berlin prosecutor.

Berlin prosecutors had previously investigated the man on suspicion of planning an attack. The inquiry was closed in June 2016 after investigators failed to prove the suspect had obtained explosives, the prosecutor's office said.

Federal prosecutors also searched the apartment of a former roommate of Amri in Berlin Tuesday who the now-dead attacker tried to reach on the morning and in the afternoon of the day of the attack. The two men had shared a room in an apartment in Berlin last year.

While investigators continue to hunt for potential accomplices, more details emerged of Amri's movements right before and immediately after the attack that indicate the attacker had carefully planned his moves.

Hours before crashing into the Christmas market, Amri lingered near the place where he stole the truck to commit his attack. Prosecutors believe it was there that Amri killed the Polish truck driver, before driving through town to the Christmas market.

Investigators have established that the weapon used to kill the Polish driver was the same one Amri shot with days later during a police check in Italy. .

In the hours before the attack, Amri briefly visited a Berlin-based Muslim association that German intelligence agencies see as one of the capital's main meeting groups for adherents to the ultraconservative Salafi branch of Islam.

Shortly after Amri managed to escape the scene of the attack, he was captured on a video camera at Berlin's busy Zoo station, located only a few meters from the scene of the crime.

"The pictures indicate that he knew he was being recorded," Ms. Köler said.

He turned to face the camera and pointed his raised index finger, a reference to the monotheism of Islam often used as an identifying sign by followers of ISIS.

Two days later, security camera footage showed Amri in Nijmegen, a Dutch city near the German border, and a few hours later in Amsterdam, Ms. Köler said. His further escape route led him through Lyon and Chambery in France on to Turin and Milan in Italy.

Belgium's federal prosecutor said Wednesday that Amri was in Brussels on Dec. 21, a confirmation that came after the city's railway police checked all security images of the Brussels North railway station.

Amri arrived in the Belgian capital by train coming from Amsterdam, at about 7 p.m. on Dec. 21, and stayed at the train station until about 9 p.m., the federal prosecutor's office said in a press release.

A Lincoln Lesson for Donald Trump

Correction

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 40% of its value over several months in 1937, not in one day as was stated in Jay Winik's Jan. 3 commentary "A Lincoln Lesson for Donald Trump."

(WSJ Jan. 6, 2017)

(END)

After his surprise win in the presidential election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln gathered a coterie of reporters and enthused, "Well boys, your troubles are over now; mine have only just begun." Lincoln didn't realize how prescient he was, or the challenges he would face.

In response to his assuming office, most of the South seceded from the Union. Then the crisis at Fort Sumter escalated, threatening to engulf the nation. Lincoln's cabinet vehemently favored diplomacy and evacuating Fort Sumter. But Lincoln, only weeks into his presidency, made a pivotal decision, declaring that he would "reprovision" the embattled Fort Sumter, an action that effectively launched the Civil War. Lincoln never imagined the war would continue for four terrible years.

Here, in history, lies a warning for Donald Trump. The president-elect, who has no formal political experience, will soon be buffeted by the hard truths that each of our presidents, including hallowed ones like Lincoln, invariably discover the hard way. The first is that whatever his agenda may be before taking office, the problems he will confront will almost inevitably differ from what he planned for. The second is that however involved his advisers, however enthusiastic his supporters, or however gregarious he himself may be, tumult is inherent in governing. He will never be able to elude the often paralyzing seclusion of presidential leadership.

Consider Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who relished the sport of politics and who in turn was loved by the American people for his joyful grin and his reassuring fireside chats. FDR discovered the unrelenting toll of presidential decision-making when, in the autumn of 1937, the New York Stock Exchange plummeted nearly 40%, its worst day since 1929.

FDR's confidence deserted him as the economy lost a breathtaking four million jobs, leaving Roosevelt's team to bemoan the "depression within a depression." Usually the nimblest of leaders, Roosevelt unexpectedly equivocated. He was accused of treading water, and even loyalists rued that FDR "doesn't know which way to turn."

In time Roosevelt was able to stem the economic bloodbath, but only to be confronted by the Nazi menace overrunning Europe. Outwardly, Roosevelt was resolute in waging World War II. Privately, he suffered. "I am walking on eggs," he bemoaned. One night at dinner in 1940 Roosevelt collapsed, a worrisome incident covered up by the White House.

By 1944, as Allied forces readied their epic D-Day invasion of Normandy, Roosevelt's health was so precarious that doctors gave him only a year to live. Sickly and feverish, he was forced to spend a month convalescing in South Carolina. This did not stop him from rushing back to Washington on the eve of the invasion and speaking to the American people. He knew that only the president could guide the nation at such a pivotal time. His doctors were right, and Roosevelt died in April 1945.

Here, then, are the prerequisites of the presidency. Despite the capable inner circle he is assembling, and his innate political skills, Mr. Trump will learn that the presidency is a forlorn place. For all his confidence, Mr. Trump will also discover that little is simple about governing. The presidency is more often characterized by the unanticipated, not the anticipated. Just as often, it loses its way.

Recent history powerfully tells the tale. Harry Truman learned the burdens within hours of assuming the presidency, when he was faced with the questions of whether and how to use the atomic bomb -- a weapon that Truman hadn't even known existed.

A youthful, slightly cocky John F. Kennedy blundered in his ill-fated summit with Nikita Khrushchev as well as in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, prompting the near-disastrous Cuban missile crisis. Lyndon Johnson, as capable a politician as there ever has been, harbored altruistic visions with his Great Society, only to be undone by the crucible of Vietnam. Richard Nixon, so sure-footed in foreign policy, was forced to resign. Jimmy Carter watched haplessly as the Soviets marched into Afghanistan and the Iranians held America hostage for 444 days. And George W. Bush, having campaigned on a platform of humility in world affairs, did an abrupt about face as he was stalked by the shadow of 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq. Barack Obama has been tormented by ISIS, Benghazi, rising health costs and Syria.

It is hard not to be impressed by President-elect Trump's enthusiasm, his seemingly endless can-do spirit and charisma, and his connection with the heartland's working man. Mr. Trump is getting down to business with the same irrepressible spirit and boldness that he has run his companies. He is clearly looking ahead.

But Mr. Trump would do well to look back toward these teachings from history too. In doing so, he will also realize that he is the steward of the precious fabric of American democracy and only one link -- a temporary one at that -- in the chain of presidents elected to watch over the nation. Like his predecessors, he will realize that humility matters, for he will not easily be able to navigate the next great crisis looming around the corner. Whether surrounded by his team or his tightly knit family members, in the final analysis he will be rendering his decisions in near total isolation.

Lincoln once commented that there was no glory in the presidency, only "ashes and blood." Truman once said of Dwight Eisenhower, "Poor Ike . . . he'll sit here and he'll say, 'Do this! Do that!' And nothing will happen." And even George Washington, so renowned for his composure, quivered during his address to the Senate after nervously improvising in his first inauguration.

Two hundred twenty-eight years later, as Mr. Trump will learn soon enough, little has changed.

The Turmoil in Turkey; The terror threat is real and is made worse by Erdogan's paranoia.

Islamic State claimed responsibility Monday for a New Year's terrorist attack at an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, and the Turks deserve Western support as they fight on the front lines against jihadists. The tragedy is that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seems intent on alienating so many of his friends and antiterror allies, including anyone who supports democratic values.

ISIS is suspected of having carried out previous attacks in Turkey, such as June's suicide bombings at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport that killed 45. Though this is the first direct claim of responsibility, ISIS is known for attacking soft targets popular with foreigners. The victims included citizens of Belgium, Canada, Kuwait, Lebanon, India, Israel, Morocco, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. ISIS said it targeted the nightclub because Christians would be "celebrating their pagan holiday."

The killer was still at large as we went to press, but the ISIS claim will make it harder for Mr. Erdogan to resort to his usual default of blaming the Kurds for every attack in Turkey. The Kurdish insurgency broke out anew after Mr. Erdogan abandoned peace talks in 2015 and some Kurds have committed atrocities.

But the escalating tempo and intensity of Turkey's Islamist insurgency reveals the folly of Mr. Erdogan's history of underestimating the ISIS threat. For years Ankara looked the other way as hard-line jihadists poured into Syria, destabilizing both sides of the border. He still sometimes implies he might let Syrian migrants flood Europe again to gain diplomatic leverage, as if the threat doesn't also hurt Turkey's security.

Mr. Erdogan's own Islamist and autocratic tendencies have also compounded the country's vulnerability. Since an attempted coup last summer, the President has purged thousands of police officers and soldiers, and the resulting talent and resources gap may have damaged Ankara's counterterror capabilities.

He is also using the coup and terrorism as excuses to crack down on institutions like a free press and independent judiciary that could help counter the Islamist threat. After Islamic State recently burned alive two Turkish soldiers, Mr. Erdogan's government instructed the Turkish media not to publish images from an Islamic State video of the murders. Does he think Turks won't hear about it?

A Wall Street Journal reporter in Turkey, Dion Nissenbaum, was detained and held incommunicado last week for reasons that were never made clear. Mr. Nissenbaum was denied contact with his family, lawyers and colleagues for nearly three days before he was released and allowed to leave the country. Our Sohrab Ahmari has written about Andrew Brunson, a Christian pastor and U.S. citizen imprisoned by Turkish police on charges of belonging to a terrorist group after 23 years raising a family in the country. The Turks have provided scant evidence for the charge.

Mr. Erdogan is polarizing Turkish society when it badly needs a unified front to fight jihadists. He also needs allies against Islamic State, but he sees treachery everywhere these days except among his new friends in Moscow. Turkey would be a more secure country, and a better one, if Mr. Erdogan's response to every problem wasn't to put more power in his own hands.

World News: Islamic State Claims Istanbul Shootings --- Extremist group says it targeted Turkey to retaliate for military campaign in Syria

Islamic State claimed responsibility Monday for a New Year's attack on an upscale Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people, saying it targeted Turkey in retaliation for military operations against the extremist group in neighboring Syria.

Turkish security forces said they were hunting for the lone gunman who opened fire with an assault rifle on revelers in a popular party spot overlooking the Bosporus before ditching his weapon and slipping away early Sunday.

Authorities released two photographs of the suspect, a young looking male with short hair and no significant beard or mustache, clad in a puffy, black winter jacket.

After President Recep Tayyip Erdogan chaired a regular cabinet meeting Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said authorities have the suspect's fingerprints and basic appearance and are close to identifying him. He said eight other people were detained in connection with the attack, and were being questioned Monday by the counterterrorism police.

Islamic State's propaganda arm characterized the gunman as a "soldier of the caliphate" and attributed the group's actions to Turkish airstrikes and artillery attacks it says have killed Muslims.

"It is natural for ISIS to claim this," a Turkish official said of Sunday's attack. ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State. But the official pointed to a discrepancy in the group's statement, which said the attacker used grenades. Authorities said only a firearm was used. The official said it was too soon to say definitively the militant group mounted the attack.

Islamic State hasn't previously said it was responsible for attacks blamed on it by Turkish authorities.

Turkey's military, along with Syrian rebels, has been fighting Islamic State in Syria in a push that Turkish officials say has killed more than 1,000 militants since it began in August. The campaign was launched after a suicide bombing at a wedding that killed more than 50 people. Turkey blamed the attack on the jihadist group.

Turkish forces are now closing in on the extremists' stronghold of al-Bab and Turkish jets and artillery pounded Islamic State targets on Monday, the military said.

The government, in what has become an increasingly routine step, has imposed a media ban on coverage of the New Year's attack, prohibiting reporting of information other than what is released by authorities. The country imposed a state of emergency after the failed coup attempt in July.

Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has been an important ally of the U.S. in the battle against Islamic State in Syria, and has been the target of a series of terrorist attacks. The attacks, some of which were carried out by Kurdish insurgents, have killed more than 300 people over the past year.

The two biggest of the three opposition parties in parliament called on the government to account for security failures in the wake of the New Year's attack, charging the administration with failing to fulfill its responsibilities as some lawmakers called for the cabinet's resignation.

The public response to the attack was a display of unity, with celebrities, politicians and popular media outlets condemning the attack and calling for solidarity. Yet some people also took to social media to condemn the government and its conservative supporters. Turkish leaders have characterized the attack as an attempt to foment unrest in the multicultural and ethnically diverse society.

Previous attacks inside Turkey thought to have been the responsibility of Islamic State have killed and wounded scores of Muslims. On Monday, Islamic State portrayed the New Year's attack as an assault on Christians. It described the targeted Reina nightclub as "one of the most well-known nightclubs where Christians were celebrating their pagan holiday."

According to Turkish authorities, 26 of the 39 victims were Turkish dual nationals or foreigners, including people from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, India, Belgium, Morocco, Iraq, Tunisia, Kuwait, Russia, Syria, Canada and Israel.

Paul Gigot: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report," as we look ahead to 2017.

And after the most unconventional presidential campaign in modern history, the country and the world await the arrival of President Donald Trump. So, from his policy priorities to his communication strategy, just what should we expect after the billionaire businessman takes the oath of office on Jan. 20?

Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor Dan Henninger, editorial board members Joe Rago and Mary Kissel and assistant editorial page editor James Freeman.

So, Dan, let's go to you first. What have we learned about Donald Trump in this transition period, from Election Day to right now, about how he's going to govern as president?

Henninger: Well, I think we've learned a couple of things, Paul. Let's talk first about the transition, the appointment of the cabinet secretaries. This was a process that they had to pull together pretty quickly, and it's by and large been very well executed. Obviously Trump has been delegating some of the choices—ome of the vetting to other people, making the final decisions. That process has gone pretty smoothly. Simultaneously, he has, indeed, continued to send out tweets, using Twitter to comment on events, and some fairly big events, like the U.N. resolution that was passed about Israel this past week. He has gotten in the middle of that. He has got in the middle of our relations with Russia.

Gigot: What does that tell us, though, Dan? What does that tell us about how he's going to govern? Is it reassuring or does it tell you anything about his style? Take communications first. What about the way he's picked the cabinet? You said it's been pretty orderly. Yet when they talk to people he's interviewed, he's really focused on certain—lmost an interpersonal relationship. You either make it work with him or not. If it doesn't mesh, you're out of there and real fast.

Henninger: Yeah. Well, that's his negotiating style. I think that's kind of—e feels that he can establish a relationship with people and they can do business with him. If that is the case, I would expect Donald Trump to be on the phone all day long talking with congressional leaders of both parties trying to see what they want, where they can strike an agreement. So, I think he's going to be a very deeply involved president, much more than any we have seen previously. He's going to use that Twitter account as a signaling mechanism. There's not going to be any "White House sources say." It's going to be "Donald Trump says."

Gigot: Oh, I disagree with you on that, Dan. I think there will be a lot of "White House sources saying," because there's going to be a lot of disagreement in this White House.

In fact, he's set up a White House with what I would describe as competing power centers. You're going to have chief of staff, Reince Priebus, as one; Steve Bannon, the Breitbart guys, as another. You have Jared Kushner, the son-in-law, another. You're going to have Mike Pence, the vice president, another. Gary Cohn, another. It could be, at worst, a Tower of Babel, real fighting. Could be, at its best, a nice fertile mix that leads to good decisions.

Freeman: Yeah. When you think Donald Trump, you don't think message discipline. That's not the first thing. But I've got to say, to stand up for his cabinet choices here—aybe this is all gut instinct, but if it is, he's got tremendous instincts. You look at Andy Puzder at Labor, Betsy DeVos at Education, Ben Carson, a reformer, at HUD, Tom Price at HHS. A lot of picks here that are—

Gigot: You feel as good about Peter Navarro at the new office of trade?

Freeman: Well, not all—rade is the big risk here. But what he's— think surprised in a good way a lot of conservatives who resisted his candidacy for so long because his history was not as a conservative. I think the cabinet picks have been strong.

Gigot: Mary?

Kissel: Well, I agree with James. You know, I think the media also often misses the fact that real Donald Trump and his Twitter account cannot run every part of government. He's appointing people who have a great amount of experience, especially with Puzder, as James points out, who can do a lot of good on their own. There's a lot of regulatory messes out there that people like Andy Puzder are going to tackle, and tackle very well. But I'm also watching the Twitter account because I see no reason that he's going to stop doing that.

Gigot: Well, it's an improvisational quality to his leadership, Joe, and it leads to unpredictability and you never know what's going to happen. I think Trump likes that. He likes keeping people on edge, even people who are on his own White House staff or in the cabinet. I wouldn't be a bit surprised, for example, to see him to use Twitter to discipline somebody in the cabinet he thinks is off the reservation.

Rago: No, I wouldn't be surprised as all. I think we should expect an administration that's as ad hoc as his campaign. But the key point is this cabinet is not going to be kicking in one direction, like the Rockettes, but Trump likes to be on top of a structure like that, where he's the decider. I think he's going to get a lot of different views, and it will come down to his personal decision.

Gigot: I want to play a clip from Sean Spicer, the new White House press secretary, incoming, that he gave to a local news outlet.

Spicer: He has this direct pipeline to the American people, where he can talk back and forth to almost 17 million people on Twitter. He can put his thoughts out and hear what they're thinking in a way that no one has ever been able to do before. But you're right, I mean, he does communicate in a much bigger way than ever has been done before, and I think that's just really an exciting part of the job.

Gigot: Dan, an exciting part of the job, Twitter, or a dangerous part of the job? I mean—o you think he's going to tweet as president, first of all?

Henninger: Oh, I think absolutely he's going to tweet as president. I think he's going to send signals through Twitter.

The question is whether he's going to be able to move the process. I mean, the campaign is not the same as Washington politics. Washington politics is very complicated. There are a lot of competing power bases. There are the congressional leadership. There's the congressional chairmen, subcommittee chairmen. There are private interests, there are the lobbies in Washington. There are the bureaucracies that have significant senior managers. This is all very hard to push. I think he'll use the Twitter account to lean on them, but he'll have to do much more politicking than he's ever done in his life to make any progress with those power bases in Washington.

Freeman: We've got to give him some credit for the Twitter. A lot of us in the media spent several election cycles talking about all the candidates that didn't get social media, didn't know how to use technology. Here's someone who figured out how to use it and to spend a lot less than other people winning a presidential campaign. So, I think he does understand being president is a different job now. The tone is going to change a little. He's not going to swing at every pitch, respond to every former Miss Universe contestant in the White House. But—

Gigot: I'm not sure that's right, actually. I think he will.

Freeman: I'm saying he's not going to swing at all of them. But it is a tool and he knows how to use it.

Kissel: It's called @RealDonaldTrump for a reason. He's authentic. It's a counterweight to the mainstream-media narrative.

Gigot: All right, thank you.

When we come back, the outgoing administration takes a parting shot at Israel and slaps some last-ditch sanctions on Russia. What do these final acts say about the President Obama foreign policy legacy and the world he leaves behind? We'll ask Gen. Jack Keane, next.

***

Secretary of State John Kerry: No American administration has done more for Israel's security than Barack Obama's. We reject the criticism that this vote abandons Israel. On the contrary, it is not this resolution that is isolating Israel, it is the permanent policy of settlement construction that risks making peace impossible.

Gigot: Secretary of State John Kerry Wednesday, defending the administration's controversial decision last week to abstain from a U.N. Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements. Kerry's remarks considered a parting shot at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose relationship with President Obama has deteriorated over the last eight years as the two have clashed over differences on settlement building and the Iran nuclear deal.

Retired four-star general Jack Keane is the chair of the Institute for the Study of War and a FOX News military analyst.

General, good to see you again. Thanks for coming.

Keane: Glad to be here, Paul.

Gigot: OK. Let's talk first about the Russian sanctions this week that President Obama put on Russia for the hacking. Do you have any doubt that Russian intelligence was behind those hacks on Democratic National Committee?

Keane: Oh, absolutely none. No doubt whatsoever that Russian intelligence was involved and no doubt whatsoever that Vladimir Putin authorized those attacks, much as he has done, Paul, in many of the elections in Eastern Europe. And sources from MI5 in England indicate that he was involved in the Brexit vote. This is a pattern of behavior. And it's all done to undermine democracies and weaken the trans-Atlantic alliance the United States has with Europe.

Gigot: The Obama administration has now put on sanctions. Are they enough, you think, to both punish those actions and serve as a deterrent going forward?

Keane: No, absolutely not. And let's just think of this. Putin annexed Crimea, and the United States and the EU imposed some sanctions on him. After those sanctions were imposed, he began to attack into eastern Ukraine. He's still doing that, occupying part of eastern Ukraine. He's made a military incursion into Syria at the direct expense of the U.S. national interest in the Middle East. Sanctions have relatively had no impact on Putin, nor will these sanctions either.

Gigot: OK. What about the U.N. resolution—ot vetoing that U.N. resolution? You combine that with the sanctions and that action on the U.N.—an you recall a transition, a presidential transition, where an outgoing administration was taking such an active policy role that, in a way, complicates—hat certainly complicates things for the next administration?

Keane: Well, it certainly does. And I think—t's disappointing, I think, to watch this behavior of an American president. This is his smallness involved in this. American presidents should have a global view and stature, and get beyond personality. This is about his personality differences with Netanyahu. And to indicate that—o let that run into a major policy decision here where we're punishing the only democracy in the Middle East, our No. 1 ally in the Middle East, and within 30 days of departing his administration, this is the outcome. It's absolutely embarrassing to watch that kind of behavior by an American president.

Gigot: Let's step back a little bit and look across the whole Obama foreign-policy legacy, eight years. Is the world order more stable than it was when he came in? Is the world safer than it was when he came in or the opposite?

Keane: Oh, it's absolutely opposite. I would ask our audience to just think in their own minds: Where is a place in the world that's been improved in the last eight years? I cannot find a place.

Gigot: How about Burma? How about Burma?

Keane: I don't give you Burma.

Gigot: OK.

Keane: The point of the matter is, is that the global security challenges, Paul— mean, they're on a scale we haven't seen since the end of World War II and the Soviet Union. We've got three powers—ussia, China, Iran—ll seeking regional domination and having some success. Russia and China completely disagree with the international order that was established after World War II, and they're trying to take it apart right before our eyes. We've got North Korea— rogue state, to be sure—rying to build a ballistic nuclear capability and threatening its use. Radical Islam, it has grown into a global jihad. And you've got ISIS, who's in 35 countries. And al Qaeda, despite killing Osama bin Laden, is a thriving, revitalized organization.

Gigot: OK—

Keane: And the last thing is cyber—

Gigot: Go ahead.

Keane: Cyber espionage is exploding on the part of Russia, China and the Iranians. They have a significant technical capability and they're taking advantage of it. And its impact in our intellectual property—e know they tried to impact our elections. And we have done nothing until just recently to try to push back on that. We'll see if the covert actions are strong enough to push back on Russia.

Gigot: That's a very scary scenario you laid out, with an awful lot of threats. So, what—s you look at President Obama's behavior, what is it that allowed these threats to emerge? What is it about his policies that— mean, it's sort of, what's the big flaw that in your view that allowed this to happen?

Keane: Yeah, that's a great question. I think he has a totally different worldview of the United States' role as it pertains to global security. It's different than every Democratic and Republican president since we've had—ince World War II. He doesn't believe that the United States should be the global leader in the world to help obtain security, stability and also economic prosperity. He's willing to disengage from the world as a result of it, in a way that no other American president has that I have seen.

And, you know, Paul, he gets paralyzed by the fear of adverse consequences. So, he sees the adverse consequence and he works that through in his mind and says that's unsatisfactory. But what he doesn't see is what is the result of doing nothing. When you do nothing, bad things happen, and that's what's been exploding in the Middle East.

Gigot: Well, I think that you're right about—hat's his ideological framework, I really agree with that, but also, I think he was reacting and overreacting in the opposite direction against what he perceived as the excesses of intervention of George W. Bush. So, he looked at what happened in Iraq, for example, he looked at what happened in—Hamas, and with pushing democracy and he said, I'm going to do the opposite because if we withdraw from the Middle East at least substantially, then fewer bad things will happen. Do you agree with that?

Keane: Yes, I do agree with it. You know, one of the banners I would put up in front of any American president and new administration is do not overreact to your predecessors' policies. I watched the Bush administration overreact to the Clinton administration, who believed they did too much nation building, sustaining other countries, and that's why we never put the commitment on Afghanistan and Iraq that should have been in there under their policy leadership. So, yes, I totally agree with that. Usually, as a result of it, you get an overreaction to the previous administration's policies, and that, in itself, is flawed.

Gigot: All right. We're going to hold over Gen. Keane here.

So, when we come back, from the growing ISIS threat to the potential for a Russian reset, Gen. Keane will take us through the global challenges facing Donald Trump and the new administration in the months ahead.

***

Gigot: Some big challenges facing President Donald Trump and his foreign policy team when he takes office Jan. 20, including the crisis in Syria, the continuing threat from Islamic terrorism, and Russia and Iran's growing influence in the Middle East.

Continuing now with retired four-star Army general Jack Keane. He's the chair of the Institute for the Study of War and a FOX News military analyst.

So, General, it's usually—t's often said that there's more continuity than change in American foreign policy when presidents change. Do you think that will be the same thing with—he same with Trump after Obama?

Keane: No, I think we're going to see a fundamental change. I think President Trump, come Jan. 20, will revert to a more traditional role of strong American leadership, use multilateral relationships in the world to help achieve stability and security. He's not looking for conflict. But what he will do is he will demonstrate, I think fairly similar to what Ronald Reagan did, by rebuilding the military, and also committing to a sense of resolve that there are times when I'd be willing to use it. He will be— think be able to achieve once again the kind of credible deterrence that this country has enjoyed in the past, and what has truly evaporated and eroded under the Obama administration.

Gigot: All right. Let's go through some of the hot spots and countries that you mentioned, emerging threats that you mentioned in the previous block, and see where you think Trump and Obama might differ.

Let's start with the Islamic State in the Middle East. A lot of people believe there may be some similarity in the strategy Trump pursues against the Islamic State than Obama has pursued, bombing from afar, relatively minimal commitment of U.S. troops. Do you think he'll be different than that?

Keane: Yeah, I think it will be because the problem we have is not so much with Iraq. The attack has been stalled there. They're trying to reignite it again. And I think in time the Iraqis, assisted by the Americans, will succeed and so the issue is really Syria, which is the ISIS safe haven. So, what's needed there—e don't have an effective ground force. I believe President Trump will ask the military: Give me some options to defeat ISIS in Syria. They will bring forth ground options that will include some U.S. forces, an Arab coalition, maybe some NATO participation, other kinds of ground options. And I believe President Trump will select likely one of those options combined with air power to get rid of this force, which is around 20,000 now, lightly armed force. They have no air power, they have no artillery, it would not take all that long to do. We just have not been able to commit to put that force together. I think he will probably make that commitment.

Gigot: Do you think Gen. Mattis, the incoming secretary of defense, will support that kind of a strategy?

Keane: Oh, absolutely. I know Jim Mattis very well. I don't want to presume all the policy decisions that he's going to be facing and recommending, but certainly I know for a fact that he's as frustrated as I have been watching this unfold over these number of years and the killing that ISIS has been able to do world-wide, largely because that organization still has a headquarters, still has resources, and still has an ideology.

Gigot: OK. Let's talk about Iran because that's a place where Donald Trump really did disagree with Barack Obama, on the nuclear deal. But he faces a fundamental question. Does he pull out of that deal when he gets in power or not, and then how does he manage it? Do you think there will be a difference on Iran?

Keane: I think the real issue with Iran has always been the strategic issue for the region. Iran wants to dominate and control the Middle East. And they use proxy fighters and proxy terrorist organizations to do that. They have enjoyed some measure of success in doing that—n Lebanon, obviously; Hamas in Gaza; Syria, Iraq and now Yemen. That is what they're truly about. Having a nuclear weapon was all about the preservation of the regime. Their strategic goal has not changed.

What the administration has got to do and put on the table is, with our allies in the region, who to a person believe that Iran is the strategic threat in the region, is push back on the Iranians' adventurism in the region using our allies as part of an unofficial alliance or actually a form of an Arab NATO. Once we start to put that on the table and then hold them accountable, which would mean sanctions and other issues that we can get involved in, I believe the Iranians will pull out of the deal themselves at some point.

Gigot: We've got one more with Russia, which in many ways may be the most complicated. President Obama put on the sanctions. Vladimir Putin said in response, well, we're going to hold off retaliating until we see how the Trump administration responds. That puts President Trump in a box when he takes office, I think, to some extent because if he pulls those sanctions off, it means that he'll be accused by some people of rewarding the people who helped him get elected.

How do you see him navigating the Russian relationship? He clearly wants a better relationship with Russia than we've had.

Keane: Listen, he'll be able to get a better relationship with Vladimir Putin very easily. And the reason is that Putin clearly is driven by anti- American policy, his desire to be on the world stage and his desire to be a world power. All of those things are motivating him and playing to his domestic audience. President Trump will easily have a better relationship than what Putin had with Obama.

Listen, Putin fooled President Bush and he intimidated President Obama. He's not going to do either one of those, I believe, with President Trump. So, the personal relationship will be considerably better.

Now, what President Trump cannot account for is that while that personal relationship may be better, we are at opposing national interests.

Gigot: Yeah, yeah.

Keane: And that is the problem we have.

Gigot: Yeah, and Donald—

Keane: And that is the issue.

Gigot: And Vladimir Putin has never been able to keep his word. Never kept his word with these other presidents. So, I think that's a potential danger for Donald Trump, too.

Keane: No. And he's got to understand that and recognize that Putin is not a friend, he's somebody to work with, and that those interests are not in the interests of the United States and we must push back on Russia's national interests.

Gigot: Thank you, Gen. Keane, for being here. Fascinating.

Still ahead, an optimistic end of 2016, with stocks soaring and consumer confidence high. Is the Trump economic bump real and will it continue in the new year?

***

Gigot: Is the Trump market bump real? The U.S. economy is certainly closing out the year on a positive note, with the Conference Board announcing this week that its Consumer Confidence Index rose in December to its highest level since 2001. The president-elect was quick to take credit for the good news, tweeting: "The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points, the highest level in more than 15 years. Thanks Donald!"

We're back with Dan Henninger, Joe Rago, Mary Kissel and James Freeman.

James, we're reading some of our friends on the left saying Donald Trump is inheriting one of the greatest economies that any new president has never inherited. Are you buying that?

Freeman: Well, I would say it has great potential when you move from the Obama agenda to the Trump agenda.

Gigot: What about the state of the economy now? How strong is it?

Freeman: It's been bumping along given great burdens placed on it by Washington, but what you've seen since the election is that rise in not just consumer confidence but business confidence. You see the small businesses in the NFIB survey looking to grow again, looking to hire again. And I think we'll see an end to what's been really an investment recession in terms of companies not willing to invest in expanding new plant and equipment, new products. And I think that's what the Trump agenda promises.

Gigot: Just to put a number on the last year, third quarter over third quarter, 1.7% growth in GDP. Faster for the third quarter alone, but for the previous year, not so great.

Kissel: I think the answer you are looking for, Paul, is this was the worst recovery in the modern era.

Gigot: Did you hear that, James? That's what I was looking for. She got it. She broke the code.

Kissel: Terrible, terrible wage growth, lousy wage growth. This president has never broken 3% annual growth, which is really a remarkable statistic when you think about it. You have millions of Americans who aren't participating in the labor force. So, yes, James, there is a lot of potential out there.

Freeman: I'm not arguing with that. I'm saying the bump is what's to come. That's why stocks have gone up.

Gigot: Joe, it does look like the consumer confidence—ou've seen the dollar very strong, suggesting stronger investment in the United States, confidence in the United States. You're seeing bond yields go up, which suggests a future growth. So, all of that is suggesting maybe the animal spirits of the economy are coming back.

Rago: I was just going to say this is the revival of animal spirits. It's—eople are looking forward to a different policy mix. If you can get a tighter labor market and all this money that's parked in cash or overseas into productive investments in the United States, you could really see a much more of a turnaround than what we've seen over the last seven years.

Gigot: So with all this bullishness, Dan, give us the contrary argument, because I want to point out that while the—ince the election, markets have been buoyant. The last two or three weeks, the stock market has actually plateaued. I'm wondering could it be there's some concern about some of the economic advisers that Trump is nominating, particularly some of his trade advisers. Peter Navarro, the economist, in particular, at a new trade office inside the White House that hasn't been part of other presidents' economic team.

Henninger: Let's pick up on that point about trade. The word about trade, putting up tariffs and so forth, is protectionism. And what does that mean? It means you are protecting existing companies. And if there's a problem in the U.S. economy right now, it's that there is very little new business creation. That is the sector of the economy where new jobs are created. Instead, we have these incumbent firms, many of them very good ones—Google, Facebook—ut you've seen, in the last few years, a tremendous amount of consolidation in telecommunications or in health insurance. Companies are combining. They're not expanding. You have no new companies, for instance. The number of new companies coming into the economy is below 10%, an historic low. Its contribution to employment is about 2%, also a historic low.

What is needed, as Joe was suggesting, is the liberation of capital to pour into the economy so that new businesses can form. Whether that would be offset by a protectionist policy is a very good question. You run the risk of running in place if you go that direction.

Gigot: James, you studied the IPO, initial public offering, history, and it's just been slow. It's been historically very bad these last years, particularly this last year.

Freeman: Yeah, 2016, a terrible year for new companies coming to the public markets. We think of some of these tech sort of giants like Uber as signifying the strength of the tech economy, but the truth is in terms of the overall number of businesses being created, we're really behind where we used to be. The Labor Department put out a report early this year. Not just tech companies but all kinds of businesses open less than a year are creating far fewer jobs than they created 20 years ago, when we had a smaller population and smaller economy. So, I think that piece—etting small businesses created, getting people optimistic enough, the animal spirits to take the leap—hat's what's been missing and that's what you hope the trade agenda doesn't screw up. That's what the tax and regulatory agenda can unleash.

Gigot: He really has to produce 3%, 4% growth, does he not? Get out of that 2% Obama trough to be able to pay off his voters in those industrial Midwest states who elected him?

Rago: There's no way he's going to raise wages without faster growth unless we can get beyond 1% to 2%, to 3% or 4%. The risk for Trump is that we're now six years into an expansion, one of the longest recoveries without a recession in U.S. history. Just not a lot of space to respond to some kind of big shock to the economy, either monetary or fiscal.

Gigot: All right, thank you, all. Fascinating.

When we come back, Republican leaders in Congress look ahead to a new administration and map out an ambitious agenda. So, will President Donald Trump sign on to their plans or does he have some of his own? How are the taxes going?

***

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: When we come back Jan. 3, we'll be moving to the ObamaCare replacement resolution. The ObamaCare repeal resolution will be the first item up in the New Year.

Gigot: With the 115th Congress set to convene for the first time on Tuesday. Republican leaders in the House and Senate are mapping out an ambitious agenda with tax reform, regulatory relief and, as you just heard, the repeal of ObamaCare topping the list. So, will President Donald Trump sign on to the Republican plans, or does he have some of his own ideas of how to proceed?

Joe, so Paul Ryan's plan in the election the year before was: I'm going to map out an agenda, get all the Republicans in the House to sign onto it, and that means we're going to take off on day one. Is that now what's going to happen?

Rago: I think we're going to find out obviously.

Gigot: Is that, do you think, going to be given a try?

Rago: What Paul Ryan has done is he built a remarkable consensus within the Republican conference around six areas of policy, whether it's tax reform, energy, health care. The House has been awfully dysfunctional for the last four years with a lot of different factions. Now you've got a big majority for some of these ideas. And as far as we know, Donald Trump has said I'm on board with this, certainly on taxes, certainly on health care.

Gigot: Do you see any potential differences, Mary, potentially emerging between the Trump agenda and the House or Senate Republican agenda? And not just policy details, but priority lists?

Kissel: Well, I think for Donald Trump, trade, as we talked about in the previous segment, is a big issue. He wants to punish companies that go abroad. That could bring him into conflict with the House. There's questions about the timing of ObamaCare repeal and replace and the form that that's going to look like.

Gigot: But— think those are both right, but will Trump want to do something more on immigration restrictions, for example put up that wall as one of his first acts, as opposed to the Republicans on the Hill, who want tax reform, ObamaCare replacement?

Kissel: I think it depends on what the wall actually is. Trump has shown some flexibility on immigration. Just look at his comments on, for instance, the Dreamers where he seemed to indicate that he was ready to strike a compromise there. So, I actually think Trump might show more flexibility and willingness to compromise with Democrats than we might give him credit for.

Gigot: And yet a lot of his supporters, Dan, are going to want to see something happen on immigration. It looked to me pretty early, I think. And Trump and Steve Bannon in the White House and some of those populists are going to be inclined—eff Sessions—o try to push something maybe faster than Republicans on the Hill may want.

Henninger: You know, Paul, there's only so much a president can really do in the first 100 or 150 days. There's a big agenda here. You're talking about immigration—et's not call it reform, but a wall. A tax bill. Financial deregulation. Repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Look, Congress's job is to grind through the details of that policy. The president's job is to provide leadership and leverage where necessary. He can either make Congress a partner or it can become the Bermuda Triangle for his presidency if he tries to push too much into it.

Gigot: Right. I agree with Dan on that. I think the nightmare scenario here is that Trump gets into war with the Republican Congress and not only will he be attacked by Democrats but he'll have differences with Republicans and then he gets very little done.

Freeman: Yeah, and I think it goes both ways, though. Mary talked about how Trump has shown flexibility on immigration. I think the Republicans in Congress also have to have some understanding that the things he made central to his candidacy, he has to deliver on in some fashion.

Now, there are parts of our border that have fences. Can we build them a little higher? Sure. I think you probably have to give him something he can say: Look, we have a wall. That doesn't mean you go where he's going or you think he might go on trade. It doesn't mean you restrict how many people can come into the U.S. But I think you probably have got to give him a wall.

Gigot: This issue of bandwidth that Dan raised is important. You can only do so many things. I only think they have a year to get the most important priorities done, Joe. What would you put at the very top of the Republican/Trump list?

Rago: I think health care, tax reform and then—

Gigot: And by health care, you mean not just repealing ObamaCare but also replacing it.

Rago: Right. What you have to understand is that the fastest-diminishing commodity in Washington is a president's political capital. It's going to be going down every day that he's in office. I think if they don't show some big movement by this summer, the inertia of Washington is going to take over and they're not going to deliver on this remarkable reform opportunity that they have got.

Gigot: Mary, I would argue what you're going to see is early victories with the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee and a lot of regulatory repeal, and those will be early victories they can rack up.

Kissel: Yeah, I think you're right. That's something that he can offer, too, to Republicans in Congress, especially that Supreme Court nomination absolutely immediately.

But also, Paul, also there's a big deal to be done on tax reform, not just with Republicans but getting Democrats on board, too. Think of the opportunity here for something like a business-tax reform that you package with a jobs bill and get some Democrats on board with some infrastructure spending. So, Donald Trump could have some big victories early on if he wants them.

Gigot: Thank you, all.

Much more to come as we look ahead to the New Year. Up next, our panelists pick their person to watch in 2017.

***

Gigot: So who will be the newsmakers in the New Year? We're back with our panelists' picks for the person to watch in 2017. Dan, start us off.

Henninger: Well, Donald Trump has promised to defeat Islamic State, so my person to watch is the new secretary of defense, former Marine general Jim Mattis. Jim Mattis was the former commander of the Marines in Anbar Province in 2004, and then was the head of the Central Command, which covers the Middle East, Pakistan and Afghanistan. He knows the area cold, from the level of boots on the ground up to 30,000 feet, Paul. After eight years with the Obama policy in the Middle East, strategy is going to be complex and even perilous. So, I say watch Jim Mattis for the way forward.

Gigot: Two points in particular: He disagrees with the historic positions of Donald Trump on Russia. Jim Mattis is much more skeptical of Vladimir Putin. And also on the budget. He'll want to expand the military and Mick Mulvany, the budget director, Dan, he is a skeptic of military spending, thinks there's a lot of deadweight.

Henninger: I think Jim Mattis and Donald Trump will have many interesting conversations.

Gigot: Joe?

Rago: Paul, my person to watch is Chuck Schumer, New York Democrat and incoming Senate minority leader. A lot of Democrats are calling themselves "the resistance." They're going to oppose Donald Trump and all his works on everything. Chuck Schumer is not, by nature or temperament, the resistance. He's a transactional deal maker. And I'm wondering if he's going to make some kind of compromise with the Trump administration, whether it's on infrastructure, immigration, or tax reform.

Gigot: But could he end up being run by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, instead of him running the Senate?

Rago: He sure could, but he's also got 10 members who are up for re- election in 2018 in states Donald Trump carried. They're going to have an incentive not to look like obstructionists.

Gigot: OK. Mary?

Kissel: I'm watching China's leader, Xi Jinping, who I think is going to test Donald Trump early and vigorously, far more than just seizing some underwater drone. I think he's going to test him for largely domestic reasons. He declared himself "core leader"; he's consolidated his power. That means he has to assert his power over the party elites. He also has to demonstrate to the Chinese people, who are suffering not just from a sluggish economy, but from corruption. He's going to have to give them something else to think about. I think that's an area, and person, we need to watch very closely.

Gigot: Do you think it's going to be a military test?

Kissel: Yes, I don't know why not.

Gigot: OK. James?

Freeman: My guy is Harold Hamm of Continental Resources. This is one of the people behind America's fracking revolution that's given was so much oil and gas here in the United States. He's now got, finally, a non-hostile government coming in, in Washington. He's also got a world where the OPEC countries are saying they're going to cut the production of oil. They normally cheat on these agreements. But let's say they cut production. So, we might see U.S. energy firms really start to dominate the world market.

Gigot: What does that do to oil prices? Do you think that they're going down because of that production or—nd what does that do to Saudi Arabia?

Freeman: This is the big question, is: Do Harold Hamm and the other frackers in the U.S. look at this as a chance to grab market share or is it an opportunity for them to boost their profits and kind of join the cartel, unofficially, that OPEC has had? To me, that's the person to watch and that's the big question because the impact for U.S. consumers and the economy is huge.

Gigot: All right.

My person to watch is the former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, the incoming National Economic Council director in the White House. It's the most important economic job in the administration—aybe even, in this case, more important than Treasury secretary. But we know very little about what he thinks. We don't know where he stands on taxes, for example. Is he a Keynesian who likes spending for growth? Protectionist? How he exerts himself in this administration is going to be crucial going forward.

Freeman: It's kind of the question of how much harm can he do if he's not on board with tax reform, Because you've got the president who wants it, the Congress wants it. If it doesn't happen, we'll know who to blame.

Gigot: He'll be on board for tax reform. The question is what kind? How low does the rate go? Does he care about tax rates being low? We know Donald Trump is not ideological.

Freeman: Right.

Gigot: We have to take one more break. When we come back, our panel's predictions, fearless predictions, for 2017.

***

Gigot: Time now for our panel's predictions for 2017. Dan, start us off.

Henninger: Well, Paul, my prediction is that under the presidency of Donald Trump the Republican Party is going to see a revision and even an upgrade of its relationship with the country's minorities, especially black Americans. You have Betsy DeVos taking over at the Education Department, a proponent of creating competition to failing public schools in the form of charters, scholarship programs for minority students. In Housing and Urban Development, you have Ben Carson. Ben Carson isn't going to be just about building houses. I think Ben Carson is going to talk about the structure of urban and inner city life. In both areas, I think you're going to see them working in conjunction with Donald Trump, addressing black Americans directly and trying to create more opportunity for them.

Gigot: Yeah. Fascinating opportunity, Dan. I hope Trump leads on that because it really could be a big opening.

Joe?

Rago: Paul, my prediction for 2017 is it's going to be the year artificial intelligence goes mainstream. This refers to when a machine learns to do a task it wasn't programmed to do, like translate a language, drive a car, for example. And it really has a huge potential to increase worker productivity, raise wages, lead to advances in science and technology. But it's also going to cause a lot of dislocations. Millions of people drive trucks or taxis for a living. AI can write a basic legal document, can even report the news. So I'm wondering if this is happening faster than politics and society is prepared.

Gigot: The crucial question for you at this table is, how fast are they becoming editorial writers? Can they learn free markets and free people, Joe?

Rago: Well, we'll have a few more years after 2017.

Freeman: If they take the lawyers along, maybe that's a good trade, right?

Kissel: —ise of the machines.

Gigot: All right. But there'll always be a need for editors, however.

Kissel: I'm going the go way out on a limb here and predict that Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front, will win the French presidency, continuing the trend of populist political surprises that we saw, starting with Brexit, and the Five Star movement and the rise of that in Italy, and others. Stranger things have happened. The Cubs won the World Series. So, that's what I'm going to predict.

Gigot: I'm going to disagree with you on that, Mary. I'm going to say that Francois Fillon is going to win. He's going to be—e's the center-right candidate, but he's moved enough to the right on immigration and nationalism to co-opt Le Pen's support. But here's the key that's really hopeful for France for the first time in five or six decades—

Kissel: That there is a Francois Fillon there.

Gigot: Yes—s economic reform. He is pushing the most aggressive economic reform agenda that I've seen in France—

Kissel: But Paul, if there's, god forbid, another major terror attack in France, I think Fillon might not be seen as strong enough. And that's where I think Le Pen might triumph.

Gigot: James?

Freeman: I think a word is going to come back into our economic discussion in 2017, and that word is "inflation." I don't think it's going to be a raging inflation, but I think this is going to be a factor again. As we have seen the economy reviving, I think it will. All of this money that's been created by the Federal Reserve the last eight years or so, I think that starts to have an impact. Banks are going to feel, under Trump, a little more free to lend, a little regulatory restraint there. So, I think the next step, probably to watch for some inflation.

Gigot: Interesting.

My prediction is that Donald Trump, President Trump, will cut a deal with Vladimir Putin. He will, in return for getting Putin's help against jihad and Islamic State, he will cut a deal in which he gives sanctions relief to Putin, ignores what's been happening in Ukraine, and lets him have his way in Syria, and say: All right, as long as you don't touch NATO, we can work together. The problem with that is, Putin never keeps his word. I think Trump wants to do that deal.

Freeman: I've got to think that Trump has some understanding, especially with Tillerson on board, that this is a guy you've got to watch carefully.

Gigot: Tillerson likes Putin.

Freeman: Tillerson has done business with Putin.

Kissel: We don't know that.

Freeman: Sort of like in "The Godfather," he did business with him but never liked him.

Gigot: Fair enough. We might be wrong on whether he likes him. We don't know that. But he has done business with him.

All right, it's going to be fascinating to watch.

Thank you all. Remember, if you have your own prediction for 2017, be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC. That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. And thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Happy New Year. We hope to see you right here next week.

Correction The Dow Jones lost 40% of its value over several months in 1937, not in one day, as an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated.

After his surprise win in the presidential election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln gathered a coterie of reporters and enthused, "Well boys, your troubles are over now; mine have only just begun." Lincoln didn't realize how prescient he was, or the challenges he would face.

In response to his assuming office, most of the South seceded from the Union. Then the crisis at Fort Sumter escalated, threatening to engulf the nation. Lincoln's cabinet vehemently favored diplomacy and evacuating Fort Sumter. But Lincoln, only weeks into his presidency, made a pivotal decision, declaring that he would "reprovision" the embattled Fort Sumter, an action that effectively launched the Civil War. Lincoln never imagined the war would continue for four terrible years.

Here, in history, lies a warning for Donald Trump. The president-elect, who has no formal political experience, will soon be buffeted by the hard truths that each of our presidents, including hallowed ones like Lincoln, invariably discover the hard way. The first is that whatever his agenda may be before taking office, the problems he will confront will almost inevitably differ from what he planned for. The second is that however involved his advisers, however enthusiastic his supporters, or however gregarious he himself may be, tumult is inherent in governing. He will never be able to elude the often paralyzing seclusion of presidential leadership.

Consider Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who relished the sport of politics and who in turn was loved by the American people for his joyful grin and his reassuring fireside chats. FDR discovered the unrelenting toll of presidential decision-making when, in the autumn of 1937, the Dow Jones plummeted nearly 40%.

FDR's confidence deserted him as the economy lost a breathtaking four million jobs, leaving Roosevelt's team to bemoan the "depression within a depression." Usually the nimblest of leaders, Roosevelt unexpectedly equivocated. He was accused of treading water, and even loyalists rued that FDR "doesn't know which way to turn."

In time Roosevelt was able to stem the economic bloodbath, but only to be confronted by the Nazi menace overrunning Europe. Outwardly, Roosevelt was resolute in waging World War II. Privately, he suffered. "I am walking on eggs," he bemoaned. One night at dinner in 1940 Roosevelt collapsed, a worrisome incident covered up by the White House.

By 1944, as Allied forces readied their epic D-Day invasion of Normandy, Roosevelt's health was so precarious that doctors gave him only a year to live. Sickly and feverish, he was forced to spend a month convalescing in South Carolina. This did not stop him from rushing back to Washington on the eve of the invasion and speaking to the American people. He knew that only the president could guide the nation at such a pivotal time. His doctors were right, and Roosevelt died in April 1945.

Here, then, are the prerequisites of the presidency. Despite the capable inner circle he is assembling, and his innate political skills, Mr. Trump will learn that the presidency is a forlorn place. For all his confidence, Mr. Trump will also discover that little is simple about governing. The presidency is more often characterized by the unanticipated, not the anticipated. Just as often, it loses its way.

Recent history powerfully tells the tale. Harry Truman learned the burdens within hours of assuming the presidency, when he was faced with the questions of whether and how to use the atomic bomb— weapon that Truman hadn't even known existed.

A youthful, slightly cocky John F. Kennedy blundered in his ill-fated summit with Nikita Khrushchev as well as in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, prompting the near-disastrous Cuban missile crisis. Lyndon Johnson, as capable a politician as there ever has been, harbored altruistic visions with his Great Society, only to be undone by the crucible of Vietnam. Richard Nixon, so sure-footed in foreign policy, was forced to resign. Jimmy Carter watched haplessly as the Soviets marched into Afghanistan and the Iranians held America hostage for 444 days. And George W. Bush, having campaigned on a platform of humility in world affairs, did an abrupt about face as he was stalked by the shadow of 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq. Barack Obama has been tormented by ISIS, Benghazi, rising health costs and Syria.

It is hard not to be impressed by President-elect Trump's enthusiasm, his seemingly endless can-do spirit and charisma, and his connection with the heartland's working man. Mr. Trump is getting down to business with the same irrepressible spirit and boldness that he has run his companies. He is clearly looking ahead.

But Mr. Trump would do well to look back toward these teachings from history too. In doing so, he will also realize that he is the steward of the precious fabric of American democracy and only one link— temporary one at that—n the chain of presidents elected to watch over the nation. Like his predecessors, he will realize that humility matters, for he will not easily be able to navigate the next great crisis looming around the corner. Whether surrounded by his team or his tightly knit family members, in the final analysis he will be rendering his decisions in near total isolation.

Lincoln once commented that there was no glory in the presidency, only "ashes and blood." Truman once said of Dwight Eisenhower, "Poor Ike . . . he'll sit here and he'll say, ‘o this! Do that!' And nothing will happen." And even George Washington, so renowned for his composure, quivered during his address to the Senate after nervously improvising in his first inauguration.

Two hundred twenty-eight years later, as Mr. Trump will learn soon enough, little has changed.

Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Istanbul Nightclub Attack; New Year's assault killed at least 39 people

Islamic State claimed responsibility Monday for a New Year's attack on an upscale Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people, saying it targeted Turkey in retaliation for military operations against the extremist group in neighboring Syria.

Turkish security forces said they were hunting for the lone gunman who opened fire with an assault rifle on revelers in a popular party spot overlooking the Bosporus before ditching his weapon and slipping away early Sunday.

Authorities released two photographs of the suspect, a young looking male with short hair and no significant beard or mustache, clad in a puffy, black winter jacket.

After President Recep Tayyip Erdogan chaired a regular cabinet meeting Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said authorities have the suspect's fingerprints and basic appearance and are close to identifying him. He said eight other people were detained in connection with the attack, and were being questioned Monday by the counterterrorism police.

Islamic State's propaganda arm characterized the gunman as a "soldier of the caliphate" and attributed the group's actions to Turkish airstrikes and artillery attacks it says have killed Muslims.

"It is natural for ISIS to claim this," a Turkish official said of Sunday's attack. ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State. But the official pointed to a discrepancy in the group's statement, which said the attacker used grenades. Authorities said only a firearm was used. The official said it was too soon to say definitively the militant group mounted the attack.

Islamic State hasn't previously said it was responsible for attacks blamed on it by Turkish authorities.

Turkey's military, along with Syrian rebels, has been fighting Islamic State in Syria in a push that Turkish officials say has killed more than 1,000 militants since it began in August. The campaign was launched after a suicide bombing at a wedding that killed more than 50 people. Turkey blamed the attack on the jihadist group.

Turkish forces are now closing in on the extremists' stronghold of al-Bab in Aleppo province and Turkish jets and artillery pounded Islamic State targets on Monday, the military said.

"The claim of responsibility issued by ISIS is the latest sign that we've entered a phase of ‘pen war' between ISIS and Turkey," said Michael Horowitz, the director of intelligence at Prime Source, an analysis and risk consultancy group.

The government, in what has become an increasingly routine step, has imposed a media ban on coverage of the New Year's attack, prohibiting reporting of information other than what is released by authorities. The country imposed a state of emergency after the failed coup attempt in July.

Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has been an important ally of the U.S. in the battle against Islamic State in Syria, and has been the target of a series of bloody terrorist attacks, including one on Istanbul's airport that left 45 people dead.

The attacks, some of which were carried out by Kurdish insurgents, have killed more than 300 people over the past year.

The two biggest of the three opposition parties in parliament called on the government to account for security failures in the wake of the New Year's attack, charging the administration with failing to fulfill its responsibilities as some lawmakers called for the cabinet's resignation.

The public response to the Sunday attack was an overwhelming display of unity, with celebrities, politicians and popular media outlets all condemning the attack and calling for solidarity. Yet some people also took to social media to condemn the government and its conservative supporters. Turkish leaders have characterized the attack as an attempt to foment unrest in the nation's multicultural and ethnically diverse society.

Mr. Kurtulmus, the government spokesman, said the attack also aimed to demoralize a nation reeling from the violence of 2016 and was retaliation for Turkey's cross-border operations, led by its incursion against Islamic State and Kurdish militants inside Syria. Turkey will continue its military campaign until it extinguishes all threats, Mr. Kurtulmus said.

Islamic State has repeatedly called on Turkey to end military operations against it, warning of escalated attacks.

The territory held by Islamic State has shrunk steadily over the past year—rom a swath of Syria and Iraq that was the size of Belgium to patchy islands of control in the two countries—n the face of separate campaigns by a U.S.-led coalition and by Russia and Syria, in addition to the Turkish efforts.

Across the border in Iraq, Baghdad's military, with American backing, is forcing Islamic State out of some of the biggest cities they once controlled.

As the group is uprooted from its strongholds, analysts say it could fall back on its roots as a guerrilla insurgency, launching hit-and-run style terror attacks and bombings.

Islamic State suicide bombings in Baghdad have been on the rise since early last year. The latest was a car bombing Monday that Iraqi officials said had killed at least 24 people and wounded 37 others at a market in the Iraqi capital's Sadr City neighborhood.

Europe's police agency, Europol, said late last year that it expects Islamic State to increasingly target Western cities as the group continues to lose territory, as a way to remain relevant through attention-grabbing headlines.

An Islamic State attacker used a truck to plow into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin in December, killing 12 and wounding nearly 50. And in Paris in November 2015, a series of coordinated attacks targeted concertgoers at the Bataclan music venue, sidewalk cafes and a football stadium, killing 130 and wounding 368.

Previous attacks inside Turkey thought to have been the responsibility of Islamic State have killed and wounded scores of Muslims which may be why the group has been reluctant to claim them if they were behind them. On Monday, Islamic State portrayed the New Year's attack as an assault on Christians. It described the targeted Reina nightclub as "one of the most well-known nightclubs where Christians were celebrating their pagan holiday."

According to Turkish authorities, 26 of the 39 victims were Turkish dual nationals or foreigners, including people from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, India, Belgium, Morocco, Iraq, Tunisia, Kuwait, Russia, Syria, Canada and Israel.

Islamic State Claims Series of Deadly Baghdad Bombings; Suicide attack in Sadr City is third such assault in recent days after Iraqi army, allied forces move to retake Mosul from terror group

Islamic State claimed a spate of bombings in Baghdad that Iraqi officials said had killed at least 28 people, days after the Iraqi army and allied forces renewed their offensive to retake the group's stronghold in Mosul.

The terror group on Monday claimed responsibility for three blasts in the Iraqi capital, two at hospitals and another in Sadr City, a predominantly Shiite Muslim neighborhood that is a frequent target of its attacks. In the Sadr City attack, day laborers gathered around a vehicle in front of a market before it was detonated, thinking the driver was looking to hire people, officials said.

Two additional unclaimed bombings also rocked the city, officials said. The five explosions wounded 49 people, they added.

The Sunni extremist group is falling back on past tactics as it comes under pressure in its major remaining Iraqi stronghold, showing it can still sow terror even in areas it doesn't control.

Islamic State frequently claims responsibility for bombings in Baghdad, although series of connected attacks there have become less common.

The group has also attacked areas far from the front lines of battle, including a November assault on the northern city of Kirkuk that took days to quell. On Sunday, it claimed an attack by five suicide bombers in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, killing eight people and wounding nearly two dozen.

Iraq's military, aided by air support from the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, in October began a long-awaited offensive on Mosul. It made quick advances on the city's outskirts in its early weeks, but has since been bogged down by the city's narrow alleys and streets.

The U.S. military on Dec. 29 announced a renewal of offensive operations by Iraqi forces. Included are Iraq's Counterterrorism Forces, the elite troops who have borne much of the fighting and sustained heavy casualties on Mosul's front lines.

"The Iraqi multiaxis advance opens two new fronts within the city and increases pressure on ISIL's dwindling ability to generate forces, move fighters or resupply," the U.S. said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

Asia's Rising Terror Risk; A string of foiled plots shows the need to keep pressure on  ISIS .

How long until Islamic State gets lucky in Asia? ISIS and its followers haven't hit the region with their worst terrorist horrors, but recent arrests in several countries show this isn't for lack of trying. Much of Asia is increasingly fertile ground for terrorist recruitment, and ISIS setbacks in Syria and Iraq could bring hardened foreign fighters back to sow terror at home.

Days after last week's ISIS truck attack at a Christmas market in Berlin killed 12, authorities in Australia arrested seven men allegedly planning to plant bombs in central Melbourne over the holidays. This was "one of the most substantial terrorist plots" of recent years, said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, with possible targets including a train station and a cathedral featured in a recent ISIS video.

Australia hasn't had a major attack since an ISIS sympathizer took 18 hostages in a Sydney cafe in 2014, two of whom died. But several foiled plots and small attacks, including a stabbing in September, have led to 57 terror-related arrests. Officials estimate that 110 Australians are fighting for ISIS in the Middle East.

Indonesia also had a tense Christmas. Police raids to disrupt suspected holiday terror plots led to several shootouts in which five militants were killed and 20 arrested. "Indonesian authorities continue to arrest terrorists who have allegedly been in the advanced stages of attack planning," Australia's government said in a recent travel warning. One alleged plot targeted the resort island of Bali, where bombings in 2002 and 2005 killed 220 people.

Officials say at least three of those killed this month were tied to Bahrun Naim, a Syria-based Indonesian believed to have coordinated the attack last January in which terrorists with guns and crude bombs killed four people in a Jakarta district popular with foreigners. Several hundred Indonesians are believed to be with ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

Malaysia recently arrested seven men allegedly plotting to attack an international school, an entertainment district and an unspecified target in nearby Burma. At least one was apparently coordinating with a Malaysian in Syria. ISIS's lone success in Malaysia to date was a small grenade attack on a bar near Kuala Lumpur in June, but weeks later authorities arrested 16 suspects for plotting to attack police. Officials in 2014 said they foiled another plot to attack pubs and a Carlsberg brewery.

"The threat of a terror attack here is at its highest level in recent times, much more so than after 9/11," Singapore's Home Affairs Minister said in March. "It is no longer a question of whether an attack will take place but really when is an attack going to take place." In August six alleged ISIS loyalists were arrested in Indonesia for plotting a rocket attack, possibly by sea, against Singapore's upscale Marina Bay district.

It's a relief that ISIS has had difficulty executing attacks in Asia as deadly as those in Europe and the Middle East, but time could be on its side. Islamist political actors are growing more powerful in Indonesia, where they're poised to depose the Christian governor of Jakarta, and Malaysia, where the ruling party has stoked Islamist grievances to distract from its corruption scandal. Saudi money funds Islamist schools and institutions in both countries.

In the restive southern Philippines, where ISIS has deputized an emir for Southeast Asia, the draw of the caliphate has made Muslim insurgent groups more ideological and more willing to cooperate across clan and ethnic lines. It doesn't help that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte threatens to evict U.S. counterterror forces. A little farther afield, the persecution of Muslims by state authorities in western China and western Burma is another boon to ISIS recruiters.

Defeating ISIS in Asia will require toppling its caliphate in the Middle East and deepening the cooperation exemplified by Indonesia's counterterror squad, Detachment 88, which works closely with the U.S. and Australia. As important is limiting the oxygen that jihadists draw from Islamist politics and anti-Muslim repression. That's a project for nearly every government in Asia to take up.
