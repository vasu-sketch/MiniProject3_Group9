I know what he meant. Lots of people know what he meant. Nonetheless, the thing about some jokes is that they’e open to interpretation, and the interpretation isn’ up to him.

“im”s Bill Maher, whose HBO talk show is “eal Time With Bill Maher.”he title is a selling point: Who knows what might fly out of anybody’ mouth at any moment? Time here is real, dammit! And on this week’ installment, on Friday night, dammit, “eal”appened.

It was the moment that Mr. Maher, not 10 minutes into the show, welcomed Ben Sasse, the Republican senator from Nebraska, a jovial, youthful guy (for a senator, anyway) with a toothy smile and black cowboy boots, whose new book, “he Vanishing American Adult,”rgues that traditional adulthood is dead. The conversation began with some softballs about the book’ premise and how much Mr. Maher agreed with it.

Mr. Maher: “our book is so right about how we have actually kind of lost the thread of what adults are anymore in this country. Adults: They wear shorts everywhere, they have cereal for dinner, and they treat comic books like they’e literature. What is your prescription for this problem?”

Mr. Sasse: “ore cereal for dinner. First of all, let’ not disagree about everything. So this is a constructive project, right? I’ not trying to beat up on millennials. But there’ something weird in human history if you can’ tell 10- and 15- and 20- and 25-year-olds apart, ’ause that’ new. Adolescence is a gift —”

Mr. Maher: “alloween used to be a kid thing.”

Mr. Sasse: “t’ not anymore?”

Mr. Maher: “ot out here. No. Adults dress up for Halloween. They don’ do that in Nebraska?”

Mr. Sasse: “t’ frowned upon. Yeah. We don’ do that quite as much.”

Mr. Maher: “ gotta get to Nebraska more.”

Mr. Sasse: “ou’e welcome. We’ love to have you work in the fields with us.”

Now, I’ going to halt the transcript before Mr. Maher delivers his controversial riposte, to say that few quick-witted comedians —nd certainly none who specialize in hot-button issues —ould let a line like “e’ love to have you work in the fields with us”it there, unharvested. In baseball, that is what they would call a fat pitch, one that leaves a batter almost morally obligated to swing.

The problem is that Mr. Maher swung as if the sport still had a Negro League. “ork in the fields?”e asked in a tone that was both funny and incredulous in a way that with certain white people right now, you’ call “oke.”e turned his nose up like someone who had just smelled curdled milk or watched Amy Schumer in “natched.”e could have stopped there: a kind of check-swing. His disdain was evident. But apparently he felt that moral obligation to swing: “enator,”e said, throwing up his hands, “’ a house nigger.”mmediately, he told the audience that he was joking. (On Saturday, he apologized. HBO called his remarks “nexcusable”nd said it would edit that segment out of future broadcasts of the show.)

I’ not a regular “eal Time”atcher, but as someone who encounters Mr. Maher’ comedy almost exclusively in moments like this, I had to ask: Isn’ this something that just happens on every Bill Maher show?

He has compared his dog to developmentally disabled children. He has questioned vaccines and claimed that Islam “as too much in common with ISIS.”fter the Sept. 11 attacks, he wondered, on his old late-night ABC program, “olitically Incorrect,”bout the nature of bravery, comparing the terrorists’uicide mission to American missiles, which he saw as a hands-off “cowardly”pproach. Advertisers pulled their spots, and the network suspended the broadcast. (It was canceled the next year.)

This is all to say that Mr. Maher has views, but what he said on Friday night isn’ among them. For one thing, it’ not even a view, per se. It was an attempt to mock Mr. Sasse’ unfortunate choice of words. (I think I knew what he meant, too: Nebraska grows too much corn for grown people to fret over who to be for Halloween.) But intention is tricky in comedy. Mr. Sasse said something that was, on its face, unsavory. You don’ need much of an imagination to envision Chris Rock, Larry Wilmore or Wanda Sykes taking a whack at that line. ABC’ sitcom “lack-ish”xists, partly, to satirize these sorts of conversational bloopers.

But Bill Maher isn’ Chris Rock. He’ not on “lack-ish.”e’ a 61-year-old white man who would never get a pass for jesting about slavery or the N-word. (His track record inspires too much doubt to give any benefit.) That’ a license reserved, arguably, for Louis C.K., or Sarah Silverman in her performance-art prime —hite comedians who have really grappled with what it means to flirt with racially inflammatory language and ideas, what it means for the flirtation to fail. Mr. Maher’ approach to television doesn’ necessitate that kind of rehearsed rumination. The appeal of “eal Time”s its on-the-spot discourse, its anti-rehearsal. That looseness can tip easily into blurting, flatulence and worse.

The insult to injury here involves the conflation of Mr. Maher’ transgression and the umbrage he feigned at being asked to work in the fields. As my sister might say: Oh, he fancy now. For a long time, black people have deployed slavery-derived hierarchies as a social and psycho-political sorting mechanism. A house assignment might have won a slave less arduous work but more suspicion and contempt from her counterparts in the fields. No one self-identifies as a house Negro —nless that person is making a joke. And even then that person probably shouldn’ be Bill Maher.

The flap over his language transpired during a weekend of more terrorism in London, and at the end of a week in which a racist spray-painted a slur on a LeBron James home in Los Angeles; and Portland, Ore., braced itself for a white supremacist rally. Mr. Maher’ incident seems fit for the basket labeled “ife’ too short.”

He didn’ commit a hate crime. He overstepped his privilege as a famous comedian. That’ all. But if he crossed a line, it’ one that, for white people, has never moved.

Meanwhile, the climate around other sorts of propriety does seem different. Last week also featured perhaps the greatest dent in Kathy Griffin’ comedy career. She lost her New Year’ Eve hosting job for CNN after staging a photo of herself and a decapitated Donald J. Trump effigy. People of all political stripes deplored her. The Secret Service was conducting an investigation of her.

And yet nobody asked me to write about Ms. Griffin —erhaps only because a lot of Americans are clinging to the idea that we need a sense of moral dignity, that it’ all we have. No matter what some people might wish for the president, we can’ wish that. Not on Instagram, not anywhere. We just can’. We understand the harm of Ms. Griffin’ transgression. But we’e not sure what to do with affronts to race like Mr. Maher’.

Still, the culture is sometimes prepared for moments like this. Mr. Maher’ joke is the sort of overidentification Bradley Whitford’ liberal kook in “et Out”ould make with his black future son-in-law: playing at being down. (For what it’ worth, “eal Time”as a Black Lives Matter image in its opening montage, which feels a little pre-emptive: Don’ worry, you guys. Bill gets it!)

Should Mr. Maher lose his job? That would be too easy. “eal Time”s the sort of laboratory where just this sort of problem is talked —r shouted —ut. It would be fascinating to see him in the next episode, if there is one, surrounded by a cast of characters who have castigated him for Friday’ scandalette. He may not learn a lesson. But there would be a lesson in that, too. We’e been not learning that one for centuries.

Manila Police Say Video Backs Casino Robbery Theory

MANILA -- Security camera footage released Saturday of the casino attack in Manila that killed 37 people shows an armed man setting fires in several rooms and stealing gambling chips but making no attempt to shoot fleeing customers and employees.

A Philippine police spokesman, Oscar Albayalde, said the authorities released the footage to show the public that the still-unidentified man acted alone and that his motive was robbery, not terrorism, in the attack early Friday morning at the Resorts World Manila.

''If he was really a terrorist, with all the ammunition he had with him, he would have shot everyone there,'' Mr. Albayalde said. ''He could have killed hundreds of people.''

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Manila attack, but the police investigation has found no evidence to support that claim, Mr. Albayalde said.

President Rodrigo Duterte, after visiting wounded soldiers in Cagayan de Oro on the island of Mindanao, joined in dismissing the claim by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

''It is not ISIS,'' the president said in his first public comment on the attack. ''He did not shoot at people. That is not the way of ISIS, whose way is brutal.''

Of the guests and employees who died, 36 were victims of smoke inhalation, Mr. Albayalde said. They had taken refuge in rooms in the gambling area rather than fleeing the building. The 37th victim, a South Korean man, died apparently of a heart attack, the South Korean Embassy said. The gunman also died, apparently of a self-inflicted wound.

The Philippines is on alert for terrorist attacks as the military battles hundreds of Islamist militants who have seized part of Marawi City in the southern Philippines.

Mr. Duterte declared martial law in the region on May 23, but the military has not been able to dislodge hundreds of fighters from two groups that have declared their loyalty to the Islamic State.

The gunman arrived alone at the Manila resort by taxi. Investigators found and interviewed the taxi driver, who said he picked up the man in the San Lazaro neighborhood of Manila, a community of low-cost, high-rise condos and shopping malls.

The driver said the man spoke fluent Tagalog. Some have speculated that the man was a foreigner because of his fair skin, large build and the fluent English he spoke at the casino.

The footage from numerous security cameras shows the man's movements during the 90-minute episode.

After he arrived, he rode up in an elevator with two women. When he stepped out, he was wearing a mask.

He walked past a metal detector without stopping. A security guard ran after him and the man began firing his weapon, identified by the police as an M4 rifle.

At that point, people began fleeing. Some shouted ''ISIS'' as they ran, said Armeen Gomez, the chief security officer of Resorts World Manila. More than 1,200 people fled the building.

The man moved through several rooms, pouring fluid on gambling tables and other furniture and setting them on fire. Officials said the building's sprinklers helped suppress the fires.

The fires were most likely a diversionary tactic while the gunman robbed the casino, Mr. Albayalde said.

The man reached a room where gambling chips were stored, broke in and loaded more than $2 million worth into a backpack.

After emerging from the room, he engaged in a brief shootout with casino security guards. He and a guard were both wounded.

Bleeding, he walked upstairs to the fifth floor. The loss of blood may have weakened him and doomed any escape plan he had.

He shot open the door of Room 510 and went inside, disappearing from the cameras' view. The police said he set the room on fire and shot himself.

The body was burned beyond recognition, Mr. Albayalde said. The authorities conducted an autopsy and collected the man's blood from the stairwell in the hope it would help identify him.

At one point, the man removed his face mask and looked directly into a camera, but that had not yet led to his identification by the police.

The authorities on Saturday played security video of the unidentified man they say acted alone when he attacked a casino. (PHOTOGRAPH BY BULLIT MARQUEZ/ASSOCIATED PRESS)

How  ISIS  Got a Foothold in the Philippines

For about two weeks now, dozens of Islamist militants have faced off against the Philippine armed forces in the city of Marawi, on the southern island of Mindanao, where most of the Philippines’uslim minority lives. The pitched battle, which is unusually fierce even by the standards of this conflict-prone part of the country, indicates that the Islamic State is now also a Southeast Asian problem and that the Philippine government may be the region’ weak link in addressing it.

While President Rodrigo Duterte focused his energies during his first year in office on waging a brutal campaign against suspected drug dealers and users, a motley coalition supporting the Islamic State —ormer guerrillas, university students, scions of political families, Christian converts to Islam —rew into a fighting force with surprising staying power. Mindanao has long been home to insurgencies, but the advent of this coalition, which is more ideological and has closer links to Islamists abroad than any local group before it, marks the government’ failure to understand how the nature of extremism in the Philippines has changed.

Pro-autonomy armed rebellions have been active in Mindanao since the 1970s. The Moro National Liberation Front (M.N.L.F.) reached a peace agreement with the government in 1996, but factions that disliked some of the deal’ terms continued to fight. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (M.I.L.F.), a splinter group with some 12,000 fighters, began negotiations the same year and nearly reached a final settlement under Mr. Duterte’ predecessor. But the peace process collapsed in early 2015 and despite a few initiatives by the new government, it remains stalemated.

Foreign terrorists have periodically appeared on the margins of the insurgencies, notably from Al Qaeda in the mid-1990s and later Jemaah Islamiyah, an Indonesia-based extremist organization. In 2005, when the M.I.L.F. expelled a small group of these men to pursue talks with the government, they joined Abu Sayyaf, another splinter group that opposed the M.N.L.F’ deal with the government. Based in the Sulu Archipelago, southwest of Mindanao, Abu Sayyaf wanted an Islamic state for Muslim Mindanao. The group became known for various kidnap-for-ransom activities, but through the mid-2000s it also welcomed foreign terrorists seeking refuge.

It was thus unsurprising that Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of Abu Sayyaf, would be among the first militants in the Philippines to pledge loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State leader, after he declared a caliphate in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014. By early 2016, a new pro-Islamic State coalition was emerging under Mr. Hapilon, uniting groups across regional and ethnic lines.

The government was dismissive of the growing threat. Soon after Mr. Duterte became president last year, he set out to destroy Abu Sayyaf in response to a series of beheadings of kidnapping victims. In fact, the kidnappers had no links to the Hapilon faction. Partly because of the government’ failure to appreciate this fact, it also failed to see that by then the Islamic State-friendly coalition already extended beyond Abu Sayyaf and that its leaders were driven by ideology rather than profit. A military offensive against Mr. Hapilon’ forces on Basilan, a small island south of Mindanao, in mid-2016 only succeeded in getting the group to move its operational headquarters to the jungles of Lanao del Sur, a province in central Mindanao. Marawi is the province’ capital.

The bombing of a night market in September 2016 in Davao, the city Mr. Duterte led as mayor before he became president, should have been a wake-up call for the government. Several suspected perpetrators later told the police that while they had acted on Mr. Hapilon’ instructions, the operation had been planned and organized by the Maute brothers, the leaders of the group based in Lanao del Sur. The Mautes were a new breed of extremists: young, charismatic, Arabic-speaking, educated in the Middle East, social-media savvy and with vast international connections. Their extended family was part of Marawi’ political and business elite, as well as related by marriage to M.I.L.F.’ highest echelons. Since last November the Maute group has clashed with the army repeatedly, twice taking over the small town of Butig.

Military operations have been no deterrent: The fighters occupying Marawi today come not just from the Lanao del Sur faction but also from the wider pro-Islamic State coalition, including from Basilan and abroad. Some of the men killed in Marawi recently were nationals of Indonesia, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

In April 2014 —ven before the caliphate was declared in Mosul —hree Malaysians joined Mr. Hapilon in Basilan. The most senior of them, known as Abu Anas the Emigré appears to have been in direct contact with the Islamic State’ central command. After Abu Anas was killed on Basilan in December 2015, Mahmud Ahmad, once a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Malaya, took over as chief strategist, financier and recruiter, first for Mr. Hapilon and later for the whole coalition. He is currently believed to be in Marawi.

In mid-2016, with travel across the Turkish border with Syria becoming increasingly difficult, Islamic State leaders endorsed the jihad in Mindanao. Last June, the group’ official media released a video showing an Indonesian, a Malaysian and a Filipino urging compatriots who could not reach Syria to go to the Philippines instead.

A steady stream of similar exhortations has appeared on pro-Islamic State channels of the social media application Telegram. The recent takeover of Marawi, greeted with euphoria by extremists on social media sites in Indonesia and elsewhere, almost certainly will lead to more foreigners wanting to fight in the Philippines.

This is why Mr. Duterte must come up with a strategy to confront the Islamic State coalition that goes beyond airstrikes and the ever-greater use of force.

Martial law, which the president declared in Mindanao on May 23, may lead to more arrests and detentions, but it will not get at the roots of radicalization: poor governance, a dysfunctional legal system and endemic poverty. Prisons, dilapidated and overcrowded, are a prime recruiting ground for terrorists.

The government urgently needs to get the peace process in Mindanao back on track. The longer it stalls, the greater the danger that disillusioned members of M.I.L.F. will join the extremist coalition.

The Duterte administration’ response to Islamist extremism so far has been to try to crush it militarily. But too often strong-arm tactics only breed more fighters —nd fighters with a desire for revenge. The Philippine government must instead come up with a comprehensive strategy to fix the social, economic and political problems that have led Islamic State ideologues to exert so much appeal in Mindanao.

LONDON —he first thing that popped up on my Twitter feed in the aftermath of the terror attack in London on Saturday night was a photo of the evacuation.

People fleeing #LondonBridge but the bloke on the right isn't spilling a drop. God Bless the Brits! pic.twitter.com/ceeaH0XxeX —oward Mannella (@hmannella) June 3, 2017

As I scrolled my timeline, I saw footage of people leaving the scene in orderly lines. Londoners offered cups of tea and a sofa to anybody in need of either. Others politely asked people to follow Transport for London’ travel advice. One man tweeted a photo of himself and friends from a pub in Vauxhall, around the corner from the attack. He wanted to let people know that they were safe —nd that they were drinking gin to Madonna’ “ike A Prayer.”

Still shut in Vauxhall Tavern. Air con unit still dripping. Madonna's Like A Prayer still playing.We are safe.We have gin.#Londonpic.twitter.com/c3REQWqU3v —ob Holley (@robholley) June 3, 2017

These moments encapsulated something about Britain’ calm, defiant response to the threat of terror. Even as we face an increasing number of attacks, we are learning to cope with grief, loss and violence in our own way.

Saturday night was the third terror attack in Britain in the last three months. On March 22, Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing three people and injuring at least 50, before emerging from his vehicle and fatally stabbing a police officer. On May 22, a bomb was set off outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester by 22-year-old Briton Salman Abedi, killing 22.

In the face of this, we’e choosing vigilance, calm and just a little bit of humor. And any fear projected on to us will be met with a very British response: Sarcasm.

On Sunday morning, CNN spoke of London’ streets being “erily quiet”ollowing the attack. Brits were quick to react.

Dear American media, can we get a few things straight? It's Sunday. The streets are quiet because nothing is open yet, apart from churches. —osamundi (@rosamundi) June 4, 2017

Woman on CNN talking about London's streets being eerily quiet. Mate, it's Sunday. They're not cowering in fear, they're having a lie in. —cottieboy (@merseytart) June 4, 2017

Later on, Andre Walker, an American journalist who writes for The New York Observer,  tweeted a photo of himself standing on Parliament terrace wielding a sword. With the photo, he wrote: “ bounty on my head. Any #\b ISIS\b0  terrorist that kills me gets £0k. I’l give my address. No police. But I’e got a sword. Good luck.”he photo was mercilessly mocked, and he deleted the tweet a few hours later —ut not before it was turned into a photoshopped meme.

A New York Times headline that said that London was “eeling”rom the Manchester attack also became the subject of British Twitter’ wrath. Brits turned #ThingsThatLeaveBritainReeling into a hashtag that started to trend higher than the news of the attack itself.

Of course, Americans are going to be quick to trot out the few outliers like Katie Hopkins, a columnist for the Daily Mail website, who said of the London attack on Sunday:

Time to fight back for Britain. Incarcerate the 3,000. Deport Imams. Close down mosques. Drain the extremist swamp https://t.co/cyvUIZeH3h —atie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) June 4, 2017

A few hours later, Ms. Hopkins was invited as a guest on Fox News, warning Americans that: “eople are cowed. People are afraid. And people are not united.”s. Hopkins may now serve as Britain’ mouthpiece to millions of Americans, but she does not speak for all us.

Saturday’ attack showed that some people crave chaos and carnage when terror strikes but, in that regard, Brits tend to disappoint. What we are good at is cups of tea, sarcastic tweets and holding on to our pint of beer in troubling times.

Manchester Bomber Met With  ISIS  Unit in Libya, Officials Say

The bomber who killed 22 people at a pop concert in Manchester, England, last month had met in Libya with members of an Islamic State unit linked to the November 2015 Paris terrorist attack, according to current and retired intelligence officials.

The content of the communications between the attacker, Salman Abedi, and the terrorist cell remains unknown. But the possibility that he was directed or enabled by Islamic State operatives in Libya, as opposed to Syria, suggests that even as the group's Middle East base is shrinking, at least one of its remote franchises is developing ways to continue attacks within Europe.

On visits to Tripoli as well as to the coastal Libyan town of Sabratha, Mr. Abedi met with operatives of the Katibat al-Battar al-Libi, a core Islamic State unit that was headquartered in Syria before some of its members dispersed to Libya.

Originally made up of Libyans who had gone to Syria to fight in the civil war, the unit became a magnet for French and Belgian foreign fighters, and several were dispatched to carry out attacks abroad. Some of the terrorist group's most devastating hits in Europe, including the coordinated attack in Paris in 2015, were shaped by alumni of the brigade.

The contacts between Mr. Abedi and Battar members occurred when he went to Libya, especially in Tripoli and Sabratha, according to a retired European intelligence chief, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the case. The former official added that Mr. Abedi kept up contact with the group after returning to Manchester, his hometown.

When Mr. Abedi was in Britain, the contacts would sometimes happen by phone, the retired official said. If the content of the call was sensitive, Mr. Abedi used phones that were disposable, or dispatches were sent from Libya by his contacts to his ''friend'' -- living in Germany or Belgium -- who then sent it to Mr. Abedi in Britain, according to the former intelligence chief.

Mr. Abedi's contacts with the Battar brigade members in Libya -- though not the details of the methods used to communicate or the specific locations -- were confirmed by a senior United States intelligence official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Both officials said that Mr. Abedi's activities in Libya remained the focus of intensive investigations.

The leaders of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, have been actively coordinating with loyalists in Libya since at least the start of 2015, sending personnel back from Syria to help them establish their fledgling colony. Their Libyan province, headquartered in the port city of Surt, grew to become their most important outside of Iraq and Syria.

After nearly two years, the Libyan branch recently lost ground, with its forces routed from more than 100 miles of coastline. But no one believes the group has been destroyed there -- instead it has dispersed, while maintaining its operational abilities.

The Battar brigade was formed by Libyan fighters who were seasoned veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. It was among the first foreign jihadist contingent to arrive in Syria in 2012, as the country's popular revolt was sliding into a broader civil war and Islamist insurgency, said Cameron Colquhoun, formerly a senior counterterrorism analyst at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, its surveillance and intelligence agency.

''One of the things I remember from my time is the fact that some of the baddest dudes in Al Qaeda were Libyan,'' he said, citing a study of seized Qaeda personnel files by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, showing that as far back as 2007, almost 20 percent of the terrorist group's fighters in Iraq were from Libya.

''When I looked at the Islamic State, the same thing was happening,'' said Mr. Colquhoun, who now runs Neon Century, a corporate intelligence consultancy in London. ''They were the most hard-core, the most violent -- the ones always willing to go to extremes when others were not. The Libyans represented the elite troops, and clearly ISIS capitalized on this.''

Soon, the Battar brigade's battlefield reputation began attracting newcomers, especially from a pipeline of recruits sent by Sharia4Belgium, a group in Brussels that lured numerous Belgian as well as French men to the cause. One was the son of a Moroccan shopkeeper who had moved to Belgium, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the future commander of the Paris attacks. Units like Battar al-Libi became the Islamic State's shock troops, specializing in the use of assault rifles and suicide belts or vests as they overrun positions. They fight as long as they can, then aim to set off their explosives at some critical spot or when they cannot go on, as happened at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris.

Mr. Colquhoun believes that it was inside the Battar brigade that Mr. Abaaoud was introduced to the techniques he later unleashed on civilians in Paris.

Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a researcher at the Middle East Forum who maintains an archive of original Islamic State documents, said that the Libyan brigade was an important fighting contingent. But after the Islamic State declared it was founding a caliphate in 2014, the unit was dissolved, as the ISIS leadership began trying to prevent the rise of battalions based on nationality or ethnicity.

Although it had been disbanded, the network the group had established survived. ''Some personnel at least went back to Libya, helping to cultivate what would become I.S.'s Libyan provinces,'' Mr. Tamimi wrote in an email. ''Some may also play a role as 'external plotters' based out of Libya.''

Mr. Colquhoun, in his research, said he discovered that the returning Libyans established training camps where they taught bomb-making and weapons use, and they opened an ''operations room'' for terror activities. Their duties included guarding high-level Islamic State leaders as well as teams conducting targeted assassinations, he said.

They also began launching terrorist strikes in the region, including attacks in 2015 on a beach in Sousse, Tunisia, and the Bardo National Museum in Tunis that killed a total of 60 people, many of them foreign tourists.

An investigation later indicated that the perpetrators in the two attacks in Tunisia had trained in the same Islamic State camp in Libya in Sabratha, the same city that Mr. Abedi is believed to have visited to meet members of the Battar brigade.

''Most of the blood spilled in Europe in the more spectacular attacks, using guns and bombs, really all began at the time when Katibat al-Battar went back to Libya,'' Mr. Colquhoun said. ''That is where the threat trajectory to Europe began -- when these men returned to Libya and had breathing space. While they were targeted by drones, the opposition they faced there was not as intense as in Syria.''

After the Sousse and Bardo attacks, the first time that a direct connection was found between Libya and an attack in Europe was in December, when a 23-year-old named Anis Amri rammed a container truck into holiday shoppers in Berlin's Breitscheidplatz, killing 12.

Two Libyan phone numbers were found on his phone, and a subsequent investigation discovered that he had traded Telegram messages with those numbers. Germany's BND intelligence agency linked the Libyan numbers to the Islamic State, according to another report by West Point's Combating Terrorism Center.

''Anis Amri, the Berlin guy, received his instructions from Libya, not Syria,'' said Peter R. Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King's College London. ''Clearly there are several centers of gravity.''

Now, Mr. Abedi's contact with the group raises the possibility, though not the certainty, of a second terrorist attack in Europe that was remotely guided from Libya.

American officials have been concerned about the Libyan ISIS franchise's development for a long time. Even as there seemed to be a lull in European attacks by the Islamic State's Syrian-based terrorism-planning cell last year, the Obama administration began intensifying a campaign of airstrikes against the group's franchise in Libya, particularly around the city of Surt.

That escalation continued until two days before President Barack Obama left office, specifically because officials feared that the Islamic State was moving its infrastructure for external operations to Libya, said a former senior United States counterterrorism official, who has left government and spoke on the condition of anonymity to not violate the individual's company privacy policy.

The Libyan developments were one of the biggest concerns of this former counterterrorism official, who was involved in targeting for the Obama administration and explained the ratcheting up of airstrikes on Libya. The former official added there was a lot of worry about Libya being where the Islamic State would displace to if it left Iraq and Syria.

It remains unclear whether the Islamic State was uprooting external attack planners from Syria and physically moving them to Libya, or if the colony in Libya simply obtained the skills on its own, following the first wave of Battar al-Libi returnees.

''My best sense of it is that it hasn't been necessarily a migration from Syria to Libya but has been rather a maturation of ISIS-Libya actually having an 'ex ops' program,'' said Joshua Geltzer, who was senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council until March and helped develop the Obama administration's strategy for targeting the Islamic State's infrastructure in Libya. He used an abbreviation for ''external operations,'' referring to the Islamic State's campaign to conduct attacks outside of its core territories.

''Those of us following ISIS closely wondered, as we tracked the threat posed by ISIS-Libya, is it part of a deliberate global plan, so that even if they are squeezed in Syria, they can run their ex ops out of somewhere else?'' said Mr. Geltzer, who now teaches law at Georgetown. ''But it's not clear whether Libya is an alternative to Syria or, more likely, a redundancy.''

Manchester Bomber Met With  ISIS  Unit in Libya, Officials Say

The bomber who killed 22 people at a pop concert in Manchester, England, last month had met in Libya with members of an Islamic State unit linked to the November 2015 Paris terrorist attack, according to current and retired intelligence officials.

The content of the communications between the attacker, Salman Abedi, and the terrorist cell remains unknown. But the possibility that he was directed or enabled by Islamic State operatives in Libya, as opposed to Syria, suggests that even as the group’ Middle East base is shrinking, at least one of its remote franchises is developing ways to continue attacks within Europe.

On visits to Tripoli as well as to the coastal Libyan town of Sabratha, Mr. Abedi met with operatives of the Katibat al-Battar al-Libi, a core Islamic State unit that was headquartered in Syria before some of its members dispersed to Libya.

Originally made up of Libyans who had gone to Syria to fight in the civil war, the unit became a magnet for French and Belgian foreign fighters, and several were dispatched to carry out attacks abroad. Some of the terrorist group’ most devastating hits in Europe, including the coordinated attack in Paris in 2015, were shaped by alumni of the brigade.

The contacts between Mr. Abedi and Battar members occurred when he went to Libya, especially in Tripoli and Sabratha, according to a retired European intelligence chief, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the case. The former official added that Mr. Abedi kept up contact with the group after returning to Manchester, his hometown.

When Mr. Abedi was in Britain, the contacts would sometimes happen by phone, the retired official said. If the content of the call was sensitive, Mr. Abedi used phones that were disposable, or dispatches were sent from Libya by his contacts to his “riend”—iving in Germany or Belgium —ho then sent it to Mr. Abedi in Britain, according to the former intelligence chief.

Mr. Abedi’ contacts with the Battar brigade members in Libya —hough not the details of the methods used to communicate or the specific locations —ere confirmed by a senior United States intelligence official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Both officials said that Mr. Abedi’ activities in Libya remained the focus of intensive investigations.

The leaders of the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0 , have been actively coordinating with loyalists in Libya since at least the start of 2015, sending personnel back from Syria to help them establish their fledgling colony. Their Libyan province, headquartered in the port city of Surt, grew to become their most important outside of Iraq and Syria.

After nearly two years, the Libyan branch recently lost ground, with its forces routed from more than 100 miles of coastline. But no one believes the group has been destroyed there —nstead it has dispersed, while maintaining its operational abilities.

The Battar brigade was formed by Libyan fighters who were seasoned veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. It was among the first foreign jihadist contingent to arrive in Syria in 2012, as the country’ popular revolt was sliding into a broader civil war and Islamist insurgency, said Cameron Colquhoun, formerly a senior counterterrorism analyst at Britain’ Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, its surveillance and intelligence agency.

“ne of the things I remember from my time is the fact that some of the baddest dudes in Al Qaeda were Libyan,”e said, citing a study of seized Qaeda personnel files by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, showing that as far back as 2007, almost 20 percent of the terrorist group’ fighters in Iraq were from Libya.

“hen I looked at the Islamic State, the same thing was happening,”aid Mr. Colquhoun, who now runs Neon Century, a corporate intelligence consultancy in London. “hey were the most hard-core, the most violent —he ones always willing to go to extremes when others were not. The Libyans represented the elite troops, and clearly ISIS capitalized on this.”

Soon, the Battar brigade’ battlefield reputation began attracting newcomers, especially from a pipeline of recruits sent by Sharia4Belgium, a group in Brussels that lured numerous Belgian as well as French men to the cause. One was the son of a Moroccan shopkeeper who had moved to Belgium, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the future commander of the Paris attacks. Units like Battar al-Libi became the Islamic State’ shock troops, specializing in the use of assault rifles and suicide belts or vests as they overrun positions. They fight as long as they can, then aim to set off their explosives at some critical spot or when they cannot go on, as happened at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris.

Mr. Colquhoun believes that it was inside the Battar brigade that Mr. Abaaoud was introduced to the techniques he later unleashed on civilians in Paris.

Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a researcher at the Middle East Forum who maintains an archive of original Islamic State documents, said that the Libyan brigade was an important fighting contingent. But after the Islamic State declared it was founding a caliphate in 2014, the unit was dissolved, as the ISIS leadership began trying to prevent the rise of battalions based on nationality or ethnicity.

Although it had been disbanded, the network the group had established survived. “ome personnel at least went back to Libya, helping to cultivate what would become I.S.’ Libyan provinces,”r. Tamimi wrote in an email. “ome may also play a role as ‘xternal plotters’ased out of Libya.”

Mr. Colquhoun, in his research, said he discovered that the returning Libyans established training camps where they taught bomb-making and weapons use, and they opened an “perations room”or terror activities. Their duties included guarding high-level Islamic State leaders as well as teams conducting targeted assassinations, he said.

They also began launching terrorist strikes in the region, including attacks in 2015 on a beach in Sousse, Tunisia, and the Bardo National Museum in Tunis that killed a total of 60 people, many of them foreign tourists.

An investigation later indicated that the perpetrators in the two attacks in Tunisia had trained in the same Islamic State camp in Libya in Sabratha, the same city that Mr. Abedi is believed to have visited to meet members of the Battar brigade.

“ost of the blood spilled in Europe in the more spectacular attacks, using guns and bombs, really all began at the time when Katibat al-Battar went back to Libya,”r. Colquhoun said. “hat is where the threat trajectory to Europe began —hen these men returned to Libya and had breathing space. While they were targeted by drones, the opposition they faced there was not as intense as in Syria.”

After the Sousse and Bardo attacks, the first time that a direct connection was found between Libya and an attack in Europe was in December, when a 23-year-old named Anis Amri rammed a container truck into holiday shoppers in Berlin’ Breitscheidplatz, killing 12.

Video of Manila Casino Attack Shows Robbery Was Goal, Police Say

MANILA —ecurity camera footage released Saturday of the casino attack in Manila that killed 37 people shows an armed man setting fires in several rooms and stealing gambling chips but making no attempt to shoot fleeing customers and employees.

A Philippine police spokesman, Oscar Albayalde, said the authorities released the footage to show the public that the still-unidentified man acted alone and that his motive was robbery, not terrorism, in the attack early Friday morning at the Resorts World Manila.

“f he was really a terrorist, with all the ammunition he had with him, he would have shot everyone there,”r. Albayalde said. “e could have killed hundreds of people.”

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Manila attack, but the police investigation has found no evidence to support that claim, Mr. Albayalde said.

President Rodrigo Duterte, after visiting wounded soldiers in Cagayan de Oro on the island of Mindanao, joined in dismissing the claim by the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0 .

“t is not ISIS,”he president said in his first public comment on the attack. “e did not shoot at people. That is not the way of ISIS, whose way is brutal.”

Of the guests and employees who died, 36 were victims of smoke inhalation, Mr. Albayalde said. They had taken refuge in rooms in the gambling area rather than fleeing the building. The 37th victim, a South Korean man, died apparently of a heart attack, the South Korean Embassy said. The gunman also died, apparently of a self-inflicted wound.

The Philippines is on alert for terrorist attacks as the military battles hundreds of Islamist militants who have seized part of Marawi City in the southern Philippines.

Mr. Duterte declared martial law in the region on May 23, but the military has not been able to dislodge hundreds of fighters from two groups that have declared their loyalty to the Islamic State.

The gunman arrived alone at the Manila resort by taxi. Investigators found and interviewed the taxi driver, who said he picked up the man in the San Lazaro neighborhood of Manila, a community of low-cost, high-rise condos and shopping malls.

The driver said the man spoke fluent Tagalog. Some have speculated that the man was a foreigner because of his fair skin, large build and the fluent English he spoke at the casino.

The footage from numerous security cameras shows the man’ movements during the 90-minute episode.

After he arrived, he rode up in an elevator with two women. When he stepped out, he was wearing a mask.

He walked past a metal detector without stopping. A security guard ran after him and the man began firing his weapon, identified by the police as an M4 rifle.

At that point, people began fleeing. Some shouted “ISIS”s they ran, said Armeen Gomez, the chief security officer of Resorts World Manila. More than 1,200 people fled the building.

The man moved through several rooms, pouring fluid on gambling tables and other furniture and setting them on fire. Officials said the building’ sprinklers helped suppress the fires.

The fires were most likely a diversionary tactic while the gunman robbed the casino, Mr. Albayalde said.

The man reached a room where gambling chips were stored, broke in and loaded more than $2 million worth into a backpack.

After emerging from the room, he engaged in a brief shootout with casino security guards. He and a guard were both wounded.

Bleeding, he walked upstairs to the fifth floor. The loss of blood may have weakened him and doomed any escape plan he had.

He shot open the door of Room 510 and went inside, disappearing from the cameras’iew. The police said he set the room on fire and shot himself.

The body was burned beyond recognition, Mr. Albayalde said. The authorities conducted an autopsy and collected the man’ blood from the stairwell in the hope it would help identify him.

At one point, the man removed his face mask and looked directly into a camera, but that had not yet led to his identification by the police.

Cousin of Brussels Bombers Is Charged With Ties to Terrorist Network

PARIS —he police in Belgium have charged a cousin of the brothers who set off suicide bombs in Brussels in March 2016 with being part of the terrorist network that planned and carried out those attacks and the attacks in Paris in November 2015.

The Belgian federal prosecutor’ office released a statement on Friday saying that the suspect, Yassine Atar, 30, had been charged with “errorist assassinations”nd “articipation as a leader in the activities of a terrorist group.”

Mr. Atar, a Belgian of Moroccan ancestry, has been in custody since last year, on suspicion of planning an attack against a “arch against fear”n the aftermath of the Brussels bombings, according to his lawyer, Séastien Courtoy. The march, which was to be held in central Brussels in March 2016, was canceled after the police overheard telephone conversations in which Mr. Atar took part, the authorities said.

Nitrogen, an ingredient that has been used in making bombs, was found on Mr. Atar’ hair and his beard, according to Mr. Courtoy. The hair samples were sent to a forensic lab. An  arson fire there last August possibly destroyed all the samples, according to the lab’ director.

Mr. Courtoy has demanded that prosecutors produce evidence against his client and has denied the charges. But over the past year, according to police documents, the police have been piecing together Mr. Atar’ role in the network. He is a cousin of the brothers Ibrahim and Khalid el-Bakraoui, who on March 22, 2016, carried out the Brussels attacks by setting off suicide bombs at an airport and in a subway station.

The attacks killed 32 people and wounded 340. Mr. Atar was also found to have had keys to an apartment on the Rue Henri Bergé6 in Brussels, which was used by the network to prepare bombs for the Brussels assaults, and possibly the Paris attacks.

In that apartment the police found the DNA of eight people suspected of involvement in the Paris and Brussels attacks —ll of them now either dead or in jail. The apartment also contained bomb-making material, traces of TATP (the substance used in the Paris and the Brussels attacks), numerous cellphones and documents, police files show.

The Belgian authorities suspect that a brother of Mr. Atar, Oussama Atar, was a leader of the Brussels network. Oussama Atar remains at large.

MANILA -- An airstrike by the Philippine military killed 11 of the country's own soldiers and injured seven others as the government struggled to take back the southern city of Marawi from insurgents loyal to the Islamic State, officials said on Thursday.

The deaths came more than a week after the military moved to capture an insurgent leader only to be surprised by heavily armed rebels who went on to seize much of the city, holding a Roman Catholic priest and several others hostage. Since then the government has been using airstrikes to try to drive out the rebels.

''A group of our military army men were hit by our own airstrikes,'' the defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, said in a text message to reporters.

''The coordination was not properly done so we hit our own people,'' he added, calling the soldiers' deaths a result of ''the fog of war.''

The stubborn resistance of the insurgents has been undercutting the military's frequent claims of success in subduing them. Philippine lawmakers on Thursday sharply criticized the government's handling of the battle in the wake of the soldiers' deaths.

Representative Gary Alejano, a former marine captain, urged the government to ''reconsider airstrikes and bombing runs and artillery bombardments in built-up areas, as it will cause tremendous damage to the properties of the people of Marawi.''

''Once the dust settles, the people of Marawi might not have homes anymore to go back to,'' he added.

Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla told The Associated Press that the plane involved in the attack, a Marchetti S-211 jet, was conducting a bombing run over insurgent positions when one bomb hit soldiers who were engaged in close combat with the fighters.

The Marchetti S-211 is a trainer jet that the Philippine Air Force later upgraded to give it attack capability. But the website MaxDefense Philippines said it had a poor serviceability record and funding issues and lacked many of the capabilities of typical attack jets, like radar and internal guns.

The Philippine military previously said that it was conducting ''precision airstrikes'' on militant positions in an effort to dislodge them. The military has also been using a combination of soldiers and helicopters to try to defeat the rebels.

A military statement issued on Thursday afternoon said that the errant airstrike came after other successful bombing runs but that ''the last ordnance round it delivered went wayward for an unknown reason'' and hit the soldiers.

The Philippine Air Force has seen little combat. Shortly after President Rodrigo Duterte took power last year, he questioned the country's decision to buy more technically advanced FA-50 supersonic fighter jets from South Korea.

''What a waste of money,'' he said. ''You cannot use them for anti-insurgency, which is the problem at the moment. You can only use these for ceremonial flyby.''

Mr. Duterte declared martial law in the southern Philippines shortly after hostilities began in Marawi early last week. The fighting erupted as the president was enjoying wide popularity among Filipinos for his crackdown on drugs, which has resulted in thousands of deaths and drawn criticism from human rights groups and Western governments for its bloodiness.

In recent days, Mr. Duterte and his government have been portraying the fight as against foreign ISIS fighters who have infiltrated the area, instead of just against local militants, saying Thursday the rebellion is ''purely ISIS.''

In ''Band Aid,'' Anna (Zoe Lister-Jones of TV's ''Life in Pieces'') and her husband, Ben (Adam Pally), are in distress. Both are frustrated artists. She's a writer who drives for Uber; he's a graphic designer who has taken on corporate work. They feel increasing pressure to have a baby from friends and from Ben's mother, none of whom know about Anna's miscarriage. Their lives are consumed with petty squabbles.

''What if we turned all our fights into songs?'' Anna asks. And while the songs have adequate toe-tapping potential, they are primarily a storytelling device, a way of lending this couples-therapy comedy some distinction. (In addition to writing, directing and starring in the movie, Ms. Lister-Jones composed the music for the tunes, mostly with Kyle Forester, and wrote the lyrics.)

Both leads are excellent together, and the movie is good at showing how Anna and Ben push each other's buttons. (Ms. Lister-Jones also has strong instincts for how to frame their spats visually.) At other times, ''Band Aid'' feels overly tidy. Will Anna and Ben fix the dripping kitchen faucet -- metaphor! -- that's seen in the first shot?

Some of the bigger laughs come from the periphery (a friend has a daughter named Isis -- after the Egyptian goddess, of course). But the movie fires wide of the mark with Dave (Fred Armisen), the recovering sex addict and cocoa-fiend neighbor who becomes Anna and Ben's drummer. Over all, ''Band Aid'' is only sometimes as cutesy as its title.

Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes.

MANILA —hirty-six bodies were found at the biggest hotel-casino in the Philippines after a gunman set fires and touched off a mass panic —nd hours after the authorities said that only the assailant had died.

The discovery of the bodies was confirmed about noon on Friday by Oscar Albayakde, a police spokesman. Another police official, Tomas Apolonio Jr. said that the victims died of smoke inhalation.

But in the early hours of Friday, Ronald dela Rosa, the director general of the national police, said “e’e cleared everything”nd “s of now the situation is going back to normal.”

Stephen Reilly, chief operating officer of Resorts World Manila, said all guests had been accounted for and were safe. The authorities said not say why it took so long for so many bodies to be found, and what had gone wrong in the investigation.

At least one employee of the casino hotel, however, appeared to be missing in the early hours after plumes of smoke had been seen pouring out of the hotel.

“here is my daughter? I haven’ heard from her. Where is she?”il Emyongco, the father of Hazel Emyongco, a 29-year-old table supervisor, asked the police and witnesses gathered outside. He said he had been waiting for her to exit for more than five hours, but had yet to see her.

When the police first rushed to the hotel, there were fears that it was under a terrorist attack. But the authorities said later that the gunman was not a terrorist.

“pparently he’ mentally disturbed,”r. Albayalde said. “hat’ why we cannot relate it to terrorism, because he didn’ shoot anyone. He just went inside, burned the dining tables, shot at the door knob”f a storage room where chips are kept. Mr. Albayalde said the gunman stole a large quantity of casino chips.

The police spokesman said of the gunman, “e’ big, and he’ white,”nd was speaking English.

Patrons jumped off balconies and fled as police officers with bomb-sniffing dogs searched Resorts World Manila complex for armed attackers early Friday. At least two dozen people were reported hurt in their rush to escape.

Hours later, the police and hotel officials said initial reports and rumors that Islamic State gunmen had invaded and set fire to the hotel casino were false, and that one man —ossibly an irate gambler with a rifle and can of gasoline —ad shot a television and set a table ablaze.

Mr. ela Rosa, director general of the national police, said his officers exchanged fire with the gunman early Friday as he hid inside the hotel. The gunman was found dead.

Mr. dela Rosa also said it was clear he was not a terrorist and instead possibly a “ore loser.”

Mr. dela Rosa’ description punctuated a cascade of confusing and sometimes contradictory accounts of what had unfolded at the casino hotel in the Pasay City neighborhood of the Philippine capital, just across from the international airport, starting just after midnight.

It came against the backdrop of a nation on edge because of a resurgent Islamist militant insurgency in the south, where President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law last week and said terrorist attacks were a possibility.

The police sealed off the area and the casino hotel was placed in lockdown as officers searched the complex.

Pleas by the police not to spread rumors via social media appeared to go largely ignored.

Mr. dela Rosa told reporters the terrorism angle made no sense considering the gunman’ behavior.

“n fact, he passed by people,”he chief said describing video recordings of the gunman taken inside. “e didn’ mind them. He was carrying a liter of gasoline, set the table on fire. Maybe he’ mad at gambling. Why did he steal the chips? Maybe he’ a sore loser.”

“t’ too early to tell, but so far as far as we are concerned there was no indication that it was ISIS,”dded Mr. dela Rosa, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “f he were, he would have mowed down those gambling or exploded a bomb.”

Another woman, who fled the casino hotel hours after the ordeal began, passed out on the sidewalk soon after making it outside.

At least 25 people were injured and taken to hospitals, a spokesman for the Pasay Chapter of the Philippine Red Cross was quoted as saying by The Manila Times. Some of the wounded were injured jumping from the hotel’ second-floor balconies to escape, the spokesman, Fernando Atienza, was quoted as saying.

“any people were running out of the resort,”aid Manuel Reyes, 25, an employee at the nearby Remington Hotel. “here were also gunshots fired. We thought that it was ordinary crime. But we are hearing from the responding policemen that armed men attacked the hotel.”

Mr. Reyes said he had helped two women run from the hotel, before going back to assist an older man.

“he man told me, ‘lease help. There are many armed men inside.’t that point I realized it was more than just an ordinary emergency.”

In a statement, Kim Molitas, a spokeswoman for the National Capitol Regional Police, implored residents not to share information about the casino hotel on social media, asking locals to “elp keep people inside Resorts World and our police safe.”

Although there was no confirmation of who was behind the attack, President Trump described it as an act of terrorism.

“t’ really very sad about what’ going on throughout the world with terror,”r. Trump said at the start of his news conference at the White House on withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate-change agreement.

Rita Katz, director of the Site Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist propaganda, wrote on Twitter that a Filipino operative of the Islamic State had said “one wolf soldiers”ere responsible.

Since May, the country’ military has been locked in a battle against Islamist groups allied with the Islamic State on the restive southern island of Mindanao.

That fighting has been centered on the city of Marawi, where thousands of residents have fled amid the mayhem. Clashes escalated last week between the security forces and members of the Abu Sayyaf extremist group who have aligned themselves with the Islamic State.

The military advanced into Marawi after having received reports that Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf leader who has declared fealty to the Islamic State, had been spotted in the area.

MANILA —n airstrike by the Philippine military killed 11 of the country’ own soldiers and injured seven others as the government struggled to take back the southern city of Marawi from insurgents loyal to the Islamic State, officials said on Thursday.

Abducted Priest Pleads to Filipino Leader

MARAWI, Philippines -- A Roman Catholic priest seized by militants loyal to the Islamic State has been shown in a video making an appeal to President Rodrigo Duterte to halt a weeklong military offensive that has devastated this southern Philippine city.

The military said on Wednesday that it was analyzing the video, which was released on social media on Tuesday. It shows the priest, the Rev. Teresito Suganob, who was abducted by gunmen last week with some parishioners, appealing for the group's safety.

The video does not indicate when or where it was recorded, but the background shows what appears to be a war-torn area, and bursts of gunfire can be heard.

Father Suganob and the parishioners were abducted during heavy firefights around Marawi, a city of 200,000 on the island of Mindanao that has been reduced almost to a ghost town.

Violence broke out early last week when troops and police officers moved into the city to capture Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the Abu Sayyaf militant group who had been spotted there. But government forces met intense resistance from Abu Sayyaf gunmen and from members of the heavily armed Maute group, which is loyal to the Islamic State.

In the recorded message, Father Suganob said he was among more than 200 people, including women and children, who had been abducted. His assertion about the number of hostages could not be verified.

''Mr. President, we are in the midst of this war,'' Father Suganub said as bursts of gunfire could be heard. ''We are asking for your help to please give what they are asking for. To withdraw forces away from Lanao del Sur and Marawi City, and to stop the air attacks, and to stop the cannons.''

The captives ''want to live another day, another month,'' he continued. ''We want to live another year, two years.''

Standing in front of what appeared to be debris and burned buildings, he said of his captors, ''They do not ask for anything, Mr. President,'' adding: ''For all we know this is their place. They are ready to die for their religion.''

Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla, a spokesman for the Philippine military, said military forensics experts had viewed the video and were analyzing its authenticity. But he dismissed it as propaganda.

''It means that they're fighting for survival, they're trapped,'' General Padilla said.

The continuing aerial bombardment of Marawi and intermittent clashes on the city's streets have trapped civilians and made it difficult for humanitarian assistance to reach them. Rebel snipers positioned themselves at vantage points as troops moved into the city, using armored vehicles as cover.

On a street near the Mindanao State University campus, hastily abandoned shops provided a glimpse of a city in chaos. At least two stores were marked with graffiti reading ''I love ISIS,'' ''Welcome ISIS'' or simply ''ISIS'' with a drawing of a skull and crossbones.

Bananas and melons were left to rot on market stalls, and slippers and other footwear were scattered. A partly burned white dump truck was abandoned in the middle of a road, and many buildings are pockmarked by bullets or destroyed by flames.

Police commandos and troops are guarding portions of the city that are back in their control, and officials say things will return to normal soon.

On Tuesday, troops recovered a huge cache of firearms from fallen rebel positions, including a .50-caliber machine gun capable of hitting targets more than a mile away. The troops also found pistols, rocket-propelled grenades, communications radios, bandoleers of ammunition and two Islamic State flags.

''This .50-caliber machine gun is a game changer,'' Maj. Rowan Rimas of the Philippine marines said. ''This can destroy our tanks.''

Asked if the rebels could win the war in Marawi, Major Rimas said: ''No, never. We will go after them.''

Mr. Duterte placed the entire island of Mindanao under military rule after the siege began.

On a separate front, Mr. Duterte issued a pointed attack on Chelsea Clinton on Wednesday after she faulted him for joking about his soldiers raping women.

''I was not joking,'' he said. ''I was being sarcastic. You listen to the speech.'' He then alluded to the affair her father, former President Bill Clinton, had with Monica Lewinsky, asking Ms. Clinton: ''How did you feel? Did you slam your father?

''That Chelsea, be careful because you live in a glass house,'' he added.

U.S. Begins Arming Syrian Kurds for Assault on Raqqa

WASHINGTON -- The United States has started arming Syrian Kurds with heavy machine guns, antitank weapons and other arms, a critical step in preparing a pivotal part of the force that will carry out the final assault on the Islamic State's de facto capital of Raqqa, Pentagon officials said.

The weapons deliveries follow the Trump administration's decision earlier in May to arm the American-backed Kurdish militias over the objections of Turkey, an important NATO ally that considers the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists.

''The U.S.-led coalition has begun issuing arms and equipment to Kurdish elements of the S.D.F.,'' Col. Ryan S. Dillon, a military spokesman in Baghdad, said in an email on Tuesday, using the abbreviation for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a combination of mostly Syrian Kurdish and Arab militias.

Colonel Dillon said the equipment provided included ''small arms, ammunition, heavy machine guns'' and antitank weapons to use against ''heavily armored vehicle-borne I.E.D.s,'' or improvised explosive devices. NBC News first reported that the arms shipments had begun.

American military commanders have long argued that arming the People's Protection Units, or Y.P.G., a Kurdish militia fighting alongside Syrian Arab forces against the Islamic State, is the fastest way to seize Raqqa.

But Turkey has strongly objected to such a move, raising fears of a backlash that could prompt the Turks to curtail their cooperation with Washington in the struggle against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Turkish officials have issued veiled threats that they would shut down allied operations at Incirlik Air Base, the major air hub for American and allied warplanes in the battle.

Turkey's National Security Council said on Wednesday that the Trump administration's decision to arm the Kurdish militia in Syria was ''not befitting of an alliance.''

Equipment provided to the Kurds, which is being drawn from stockpiles in the region, will be limited in quantity and by mission, and will be doled out incrementally as objectives are reached, Colonel Dillon said.

American military officials have insisted for months that the weapons are needed to help the lightly armed Kurdish and Arab fighters cope with urban warfare in Raqqa against Islamic State militants who have been building fortifications for months and are equipped with car bombs and even some tanks they captured from the Syrian Army.

Thousands of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters have pushed to within about two miles of the city, where American military officials and humanitarian groups are bracing for a bloody, monthslong battle -- similar to the fight Iraqi forces have carried out in Mosul, another Islamic State stronghold. In preparation for the assault, American and allied warplanes have intensified airstrikes against militant forces in and around Raqqa in recent weeks.

At the same time, the Kurdish and Arab militias, which American Special Operations forces are advising, have been tightening a rough cordon around most of the city, capturing dozens of small towns and villages as they go. The fighters have surrounded Raqqa from the north, the west and the east. The extremists still have an exit from the south, even though the American-led coalition destroyed two southern bridges over the Euphrates River.

To address Turkish concerns that the arms might be used against them after the fight for Raqqa is over, the supply of weapons and ammunition will be limited to what the Kurds and Arab fighters need to carry out specific operations, American officials said.

''Wherever possible, our advisers will monitor the use of the weapons and supplies we give the Kurdish elements of the S.D.F., ensuring use only against ISIS,'' Colonel Dillon said. ''Any alleged misuse or diversion of U.S. support will be taken seriously and lead to the possible curtailment of support, if verified.''

The United States has long worked with the Y.P.G. under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The American military has always emphasized that those forces include Arab fighters, who make up nearly half of the total force and most of the fighters near Raqqa. But the Y.P.G. is generally considered to have the most experienced and battle-hardened fighters.

The Turkish government has long insisted that the Kurdish militia is closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a separatist group. That group is listed by Turkey, the United States and Europe as a terrorist organization.

Some Syria analysts said on Wednesday that the militias would need to include more of the local Sunni Arab tribes to maintain the fighting force's potency after the battle for Raqqa, if they aim to vanquish pockets of remaining Islamic State resistance in the region.

''Arming the Kurdish elements of the S.D.F. will make them more militarily effective against ISIS in Raqqa,'' said Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. But, he added, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, ''if they don't expand to include more of the Sunni Arab tribes of the Euphrates River valley, who make up the majority there, the S.D.F. will have a hard time holding that area because of the Kurdish-Arab split, leaving that area vulnerable for an Assad regime comeback.''

Trump's United American Emirate

SEOUL, South Korea -- President Trump's trip to Europe was truly historic.

He left our most important allies there so uncertain about America's commitment to their security from Russia and to shared values on trade and climate change that German leader Angela Merkel was prompted to tell her countrymen that Europe's days of relying on America are ''over to a certain extent,'' and therefore Germany and its European allies ''really must take our fate into our own hands.''

No U.S. president before had ever put a crack in the Atlantic alliance on his inaugural tour. Historic.

Merkel is just the first major leader to say out loud what every American ally is now realizing: America is under new management. ''Who is America today?'' is the first question I've been asked on each stop through New Zealand, Australia and South Korea. My answer: We're not the U.S.A. anymore. We're the new U.A.E.: the United American Emirate.

We have an emir. His name is Donald. We have a crown prince. His name is Jared. We have a crown princess. Her name is Ivanka. We have a consultative council (Congress) that rubber-stamps whatever the emir wants. And like any good monarchy, our ruling family sees no conflict of interest between its personal businesses and those of the state.

So any lingering Kennedyesque thoughts about us should be banished, I explained. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay no price, bear no burden, meet no hardship, support no friend, oppose no foe to assure the success of liberty -- unless we're paid in advance. And we take cash, checks, gold, Visa, American Express , Bitcoin and memberships in Mar-a-Lago.

The Trump doctrine is very simple: There are just four threats in the world: terrorists who will kill us, immigrants who will rape us or take our jobs, importers and exporters who will take our industries -- and North Korea. Threats to democracy, free trade, the environment and human rights are no longer on our menu. Therefore, no matter how unsavory you are as a foreign leader, you can be the United American Emirate's best friend if you:

1.) Pay us by buying our weapons. I warn you, though, Saudi Arabia has set the bar very high, starting at $110 billion.

2.) Pay us in higher defense spending for NATO -- not to deter Russia, which is using cyberwarfare to disrupt every democratic election it can, but to deter ''terrorism,'' something that tanks and planes are useless against.

3.) Pay us in trade concessions. And it doesn't matter how lame those concessions are. All that matters is that Emir Trump can claim ''concessions.'' See the recent ''trade concessions'' to Trump from China. (Pay no attention to that laughter from Beijing.)

4.) Pay us by freeing any U.S. citizen you arrested on trumped-up charges to annoy Barack Obama and to intimidate human rights activists. See Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's release of a U.S.-Egyptian charity worker, Aya Hijazi, who was working with homeless children.

5.) Pay us by grossly flattering our emir about how much of an improvement he is over Obama. See President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Bibi Netanyahu of Israel.

6.) Be Russia, and you pay nothing.

Now, if you do any one of these six things the United American Emirate's commitment to you -- and it's ironclad -- is that you can do anything you want ''out back.'' You can deprive your people of whatever human rights you like out back. You can be as corrupt as you want out back. You can steal as many elections as you like out back. Just keep the arms purchases coming, the NATO dues rising, the phony trade concessions flowing and the compliments gushing -- or be Vladimir Putin -- and anything goes.

Too harsh? Not at all. Being in Korea and seeing how much this country has grown out of poverty over the last 50 years by adopting all of our values -- so much so that it just impeached its president for corruption after a peaceful ''candlelight'' mass protest based entirely on American democratic software -- it makes you weep to think that virtually the only thing Trump's had to say about Korea is that it's a freeloader on our army (not even true) and needs to pay up.

Does Trump have a point that German economic policies have dampened its imports and disadvantaged southern Europe? Yes, he does. And NATO members should fulfill the alliance's long-term spending targets. But how much is Germany spending to absorb one million Syrian refugees so they won't be joining ISIS? How much security is that buying the world? The U.S. took 18,000 Syrians. Trump's friend Putin took zero, but Trump never thinks about such things.

It took us decades to build the Atlantic alliance and it has brought us so many tangible and intangible benefits in the form of security, stability, growth and friendships. Trump could actually break it, not just crack it.

This week for the first time I saw the official photographs that now grace the entry halls of all U.S. embassies. Vice President Mike Pence is smiling warmly. Trump is actually scowling. If his picture had a caption, it would be: ''Get off my lawn.''

It could also say: ''Let all who enter this embassy know: We don't do alliances any more. We only do Master Limited Partnerships. Interested? Call 1-202-456-1414. Operators are standing by.''

SEOUL, South Korea —resident Trump’ trip to Europe was truly historic.

He left our most important allies there so uncertain about America’ commitment to their security from Russia and to shared values on trade and climate change that German leader Angela Merkel was prompted to tell her countrymen that Europe’ days of relying on America are “ver to a certain extent,”nd therefore Germany and its European allies “eally must take our fate into our own hands.”

No U.S. president before had ever put a crack in the Atlantic alliance on his inaugural tour. Historic.

Merkel is just the first major leader to say out loud what every American ally is now realizing: America is under new management. “ho is America today?”s the first question I’e been asked on each stop through New Zealand, Australia and South Korea. My answer: We’e not the U.S.A. anymore. We’e the new U.A.E.: the United American Emirate.

We have an emir. His name is Donald. We have a crown prince. His name is Jared. We have a crown princess. Her name is Ivanka. We have a consultative council (Congress) that rubber-stamps whatever the emir wants. And like any good monarchy, our ruling family sees no conflict of interest between its personal businesses and those of the state.

So any lingering Kennedyesque thoughts about us should be banished, I explained. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay no price, bear no burden, meet no hardship, support no friend, oppose no foe to assure the success of liberty —nless we’e paid in advance. And we take cash, checks, gold, Visa, American Express , Bitcoin and memberships in Mar-a-Lago.

The Trump doctrine is very simple: There are just four threats in the world: terrorists who will kill us, immigrants who will rape us or take our jobs, importers and exporters who will take our industries —nd North Korea. Threats to democracy, free trade, the environment and human rights are no longer on our menu. Therefore, no matter how unsavory you are as a foreign leader, you can be the United American Emirate’ best friend if you:

1.) Pay us by buying our weapons. I warn you, though, Saudi Arabia has set the bar very high, starting at $110 billion.

2.) Pay us in higher defense spending for NATO —ot to deter Russia, which is using cyberwarfare to disrupt every democratic election it can, but to deter “errorism,”omething that tanks and planes are useless against.

3.) Pay us in trade concessions. And it doesn’ matter how lame those concessions are. All that matters is that Emir Trump can claim “oncessions.”ee the recent “rade concessions”o Trump from China. (Pay no attention to that laughter from Beijing.)

4.) Pay us by freeing any U.S. citizen you arrested on trumped-up charges to annoy Barack Obama and to intimidate human rights activists. See Egypt’ President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’ release of a U.S.-Egyptian charity worker, Aya Hijazi, who was working with homeless children.

5.) Pay us by grossly flattering our emir about how much of an improvement he is over Obama. See President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Bibi Netanyahu of Israel.

6.) Be Russia, and you pay nothing.

Now, if you do any one of these six things the United American Emirate’ commitment to you —nd it’ ironclad —s that you can do anything you want “ut back.”ou can deprive your people of whatever human rights you like out back. You can be as corrupt as you want out back. You can steal as many elections as you like out back. Just keep the arms purchases coming, the NATO dues rising, the phony trade concessions flowing and the compliments gushing —r be Vladimir Putin —nd anything goes.

Too harsh? Not at all. Being in Korea and seeing how much this country has grown out of poverty over the last 50 years by adopting all of our values —o much so that it just impeached its president for corruption after a peaceful “andlelight”ass protest based entirely on American democratic software —t makes you weep to think that virtually the only thing Trump’ had to say about Korea is that it’ a freeloader on our army (not even true) and needs to pay up.

Does Trump have a point that German economic policies have dampened its imports and disadvantaged southern Europe? Yes, he does. And NATO members should fulfill the alliance’ long-term spending targets. But how much is Germany spending to absorb one million Syrian refugees so they won’ be joining ISIS? How much security is that buying the world? The U.S. took 18,000 Syrians. Trump’ friend Putin took zero, but Trump never thinks about such things.

It took us decades to build the Atlantic alliance and it has brought us so many tangible and intangible benefits in the form of security, stability, growth and friendships. Trump could actually break it, not just crack it.

This week for the first time I saw the official photographs that now grace the entry halls of all U.S. embassies. Vice President Mike Pence is smiling warmly. Trump is actually scowling. If his picture had a caption, it would be: “et off my lawn.”

It could also say: “et all who enter this embassy know: We don’ do alliances any more. We only do Master Limited Partnerships. Interested? Call 1-202-456-1414. Operators are standing by.”

CORRECTION APPENDEDThe details are eerily familiar: a family outing, a suicide bomber, more than a dozen people -- many of them children -- killed in an attack later claimed by the Islamic State.

An explosion early Tuesday at an ice cream parlor in Baghdad shared many of the same heart-wrenching characteristics of last week's attack at an arena in Manchester, England. And that was just the start of the violence on Tuesday in a city where these kinds of terrorist attacks have actually been on the decline this year.

First, the Islamic State targeted the popular Al Faqma shop in the central Karrada neighborhood of Baghdad, where families had gathered to celebrate iftar and break their daylong fast during the holy month of Ramadan.

On most nights during Ramadan, when temperatures can top 100 degrees, families can be found under the shop's water-misting fans, eating ice cream from wafer cups.

That nightly respite was abruptly ended on Tuesday, just after midnight, when Islamic State militants remotely detonated a car that had been rigged with explosives and parked near the shop, the Iraqi authorities told reporters. Closed-circuit video captured the moment an enormous fireball erupted along a busy thoroughfare.

The bombing killed 17 people and wounded 32 others, according to the authorities. Of the victims, three were children, ages 4, 6 and 8.

''We were expecting to be targeted sooner or later because Karrada had been the favorite area for terrorists to implement their attacks,'' said Mustafa Aljibour, the shop's manager. ''This ice cream shop has been a place for all Iraqis no matter where they are from. It was turned from a very beautiful place into a dark hell.''

Videos posted to social media after the attack show a scene of chaos, with bodies strewn across the shop's colorful benches. In one, a little girl walks seemingly dazed through the carnage.

Hours later, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, struck again at the heart of Baghdad -- this time during the evening rush on Tuesday, as people were finishing their shopping before the iftar feasting. Fourteen people were killed and 34 were wounded when a bomb went off outside a government pension office.

Photographs taken after the attack show the charred wreckage of burned-out automobiles and a watermelon seller's destroyed goods.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks in two posts to a social media channel the group typically uses.

Even as ISIS has lost territory in Iraq, it has increased the intensity of its strikes, often against Shiite civilians. (On Tuesday, the group confirmed that it had chosen its latest targets because they were known gathering places for Shiites.)

Later on Tuesday, as word spread of four more attacks throughout the country, mourners, many of them women, were seen at the sites of the two Baghdad attacks.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a bombing at an ice cream shop in Baghdad misstated the trend in the number of terrorist attacks in the city. Such attacks have declined this year, compared with 2016; they have not increased.

MARAWI, Philippines — Roman Catholic priest seized by militants loyal to the Islamic State has been shown in a video making an appeal to President Rodrigo Duterte to halt a weeklong military offensive that has devastated this southern Philippine city.

The military said on Wednesday that it was analyzing the video, which was released on social media on Tuesday. It shows the priest, the Rev. Teresito Suganob, who was abducted by gunmen last week with some parishioners, appealing for the group’ safety.

The video does not indicate when or where it was recorded, but the background shows what appears to be a war-torn area, and bursts of gunfire can be heard.

Father Suganob and the parishioners were abducted during heavy firefights around Marawi, a city of 200,000 on the island of Mindanao that has been reduced almost to a ghost town.

Violence broke out early last week when troops and  police officers moved into the city to capture Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the Abu Sayyaf militant group who had been spotted there. But government forces met intense resistance from Abu Sayyaf gunmen and from members of the heavily armed Maute group, which is loyal to the Islamic State.

In the recorded message, Father Suganob said he was among more than 200 people, including women and children, who had been abducted. His assertion about the number of hostages could not be verified.

“r. President, we are in the midst of this war,”ather Suganub said as bursts of gunfire could be heard. “e are asking for your help to please give what they are asking for. To withdraw forces away from Lanao del Sur and Marawi City, and to stop the air attacks, and to stop the cannons.”

The captives “ant to live another day, another month,”e continued. “e want to live another year, two years.”

Standing in front of what appeared to be debris and burned buildings, he said of his captors, “hey do not ask for anything, Mr. President,”dding: “or all we know this is their place. They are ready to die for their religion.”

Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla, a spokesman for the Philippine military, said military forensics experts had viewed the video and were analyzing its authenticity. But he dismissed it as propaganda.

“t means that they’e fighting for survival, they’e trapped,”eneral Padilla said.

The continuing aerial bombardment of Marawi and intermittent clashes on the city’ streets have trapped civilians and made it difficult for humanitarian assistance to reach them. Rebel snipers positioned themselves at vantage points as troops moved into the city, using armored vehicles as cover.

On a street near the Mindanao State University campus, hastily abandoned shops provided a glimpse of a city in chaos. At least two stores were marked with graffiti reading “ love ISIS,”“elcome ISIS”r simply “ISIS”ith a drawing of a skull and crossbones.

Bananas and melons were left to rot on market stalls, and slippers and other footwear were scattered. A partly burned white dump truck was abandoned in the middle of a road, and many buildings are pockmarked by bullets or destroyed by flames.

Police commandos and troops are guarding portions of the city that are back in their control, and officials say things will return to normal soon.

On Tuesday, troops recovered a huge cache of firearms from fallen rebel positions, including a .50-caliber machine gun capable of hitting targets more than a mile away. The troops also found pistols, rocket-propelled grenades, communications radios, bandoleers of ammunition and two Islamic State flags.

“his .50-caliber machine gun is a game changer,”aj. Rowan Rimas of the Philippine marines said. “his can destroy our tanks.”

Asked if the rebels could win the war in Marawi, Major Rimas said: “o, never. We will go after them.”

Mr. Duterte placed the entire island of Mindanao under military rule after the siege began.

On a separate front, Mr. Duterte issued a pointed attack on Chelsea Clinton on Wednesday after she faulted him for joking about his soldiers raping women.

“ was not joking,”e said. “ was being sarcastic. You listen to the speech.”e then alluded to the affair her father, former President Bill Clinton, had with Monica Lewinsky, asking Ms. Clinton: “ow did you feel? Did you slam your father?

“hat Chelsea, be careful because you live in a glass house,”e added.

Death, Ruin and 'Gunfire Everywhere' in Besieged Philippine City

MARAWI, Philippines -- After she heard the first few shots ring out a week ago in Marawi, the center of Islamic faith in this predominantly Christian nation, Jemaliah Batingulo said she locked all the doors to keep her five children safe inside.

But when young masked men with long rifles barged into nearby homes and began shooting non-Muslims, she said, she grabbed her children and quickly escaped. Minutes later, she saw her wooden house burst into flames.

''There was gunfire everywhere,'' Ms. Batingulo, 36, said on Tuesday. ''We all started running and running until the edge of town. We didn't have any food, just water we grabbed before fleeing.''

Ms. Batingulo was one of thousands of people forced to flee the onslaught of militants loyal to the Islamic State that has convulsed this city of 200,000, prompting President Rodrigo Duterte to impose martial law on the southern Philippines and posing a major challenge to his government.

Ms. Batingulo, who is Muslim, said that three months ago, her husband was fatally shot by several men she described as ''young fighters'' after an argument, the first of several violent episodes that she said underlined the militants' infiltration of the city.

She said her husband had become increasingly concerned about the extreme beliefs espoused by the young men, who flocked to the local mosque, where this month religious leaders held a series of meetings with foreigners whom officials here described as militants.

At a gymnasium in Marawi set up as a makeshift shelter for those who had fled the fighting, Ms. Batingulo and others described days of sheer terror in a once relatively peaceful city on the island of Mindanao known more for producing Islamic scholars than violence.

As Alinoor Tarip, 22, struggled to put his colicky 1-year-old daughter, Hamida, to sleep, he said he was ''enraged'' by the clashes consuming his hometown.

''We were trapped inside our family home in the first two days,'' he said. ''But they didn't harm us when we told them we were Muslims. Perhaps they saw my baby when they knocked.''

''They asked me to recite some verses in the Quran and left when they were satisfied,'' he said.

He added that 10 of his relatives were in his house during the siege, where they were determined to stay for the long haul. But then some fighters took over an abandoned home next door, and used it to launch attacks against the military and police commandos struggling to retake the city.

When there was a lull in the fighting, he said, he and his relatives walked out, tying white strips of cloth on sticks -- to signify they were noncombatants -- as they stepped over piles of debris.

''On the streets were bodies,'' he said. ''I saw a dog chewing on a cadaver. The stench was overpowering.''

He recalled telling his shocked mother-in-law to ignore what she saw and just walk quickly.

''My wife cried when she saw our community,'' he said. ''Many homes were pockmarked. Some were still smoldering.''

When they reached the relative safety of another part of town, he saw a military helicopter swoop in and fire a rocket in the direction of their house.

''There was smoke rising from what used to be our home,'' he said. Of the militants, he asked, ''They claim they are holy warriors. What is holy with killing people?''

Marawi first erupted in flames last week when the military and the police moved to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of Abu Sayyaf, an extremist group wanted for a string of atrocities, including bombings and kidnappings.

But the government forces faced surprisingly strong resistance from heavily armed young fighters from the Maute group, radical Islamist fighters blamed for a recent spate of bombings. The government said foreign fighters believed to be from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia aided the group.

Intense clashes followed as the insurgents spread out across the city, which is halved by the Agus River, a crucial trading and transportation route in the region.

As the fighting entered its second week on Tuesday, the death toll stood at 65 fighters, 24 civilians and 20 government troops, the authorities said. The government said it had retaken about 85 percent of the city, but the militants had positioned snipers in buildings who were aiming at soldiers.

Fighting had decreased somewhat from the day before, with government air attacks taking place in the morning. One storefront had been vandalized with the words ''I love ISIS.''

The International Committee of the Red Cross said about 3,000 people were still believed to be trapped in their homes, many of them older or sick people who were left behind in the first few waves of evacuees.

Zia Alonto Adiong, a spokesman for the Lanao del Sur provincial government, urged civilians who were able to move to ''make their way to the holding units of the Marines'' to get out of harm's way.

The Red Cross said it was trying to create a humanitarian corridor to bring out the civilians.

''It's very difficult to go into the fighting zones to do anything,'' said Martin Thalmann, a Red Cross official who was in the area on Friday trying to negotiate a temporary halt to the violence. ''We understand that there are also the elderly and the sick people who need transport because they cannot walk.''

At the moment, neither side appeared willing to take the first step toward a cease-fire, he said.

''What we are hearing is alarming in the sense that there are a lot of people still in there,'' Mr. Thalmann said.

As Ms. Batingulo looked at one of her children, silently playing with a broken toy truck on the packed gymnasium floor, she recalled how she had to carry the child most of the way to safety.

Still, she said, she counted herself lucky that they all survived.

''But I do not know about the future,'' she said, crying.

Settlements With New Jersey Suburb Clear the Way for a Proposed Mosque

By RICK ROJAS

A proposed mosque that had been blocked by officials in a New Jersey suburb will now be allowed to move forward after settlements were reached on Tuesday in lawsuits that accused the township of discriminating against Muslims.

Officials in the suburb, Bernards Township in Somerset County, voted last week to agree to the settlements, which will require the township to pay a little more than $3 million.

The township will also have to back down on some of its previous requirements -- including a request for more than twice the number of parking spaces originally planned -- which were cited in the lawsuits as complications created to stymie the mosque's construction. In addition, township officials will have to participate in diversity and inclusion training.

The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge, a Muslim organization in an unincorporated neighborhood in the township, bought a four-acre plot in 2011 in an area where zoning permitted houses of worship. It developed plans to build a mosque of more than 4,000 square feet, with a prayer room large enough for 150 people. The group said it tailored its plans so that the mosque would blend into the neighborhood, forgoing a dome and designing its minarets to look like chimneys and be shorter than the steeples of churches in town.

But after four years, and dozens of public meetings, the township's planning board denied the application, citing reasons such as storm water management and potential disruption to neighbors.

Last year, the Islamic Society, a 70-member group led by a former township mayor, filed a suit in Federal District Court accusing the township of turning ''what should have been a simple board approval'' into a ''Kafkaesque process.''

Soon after, the United States Justice Department filed its own suit, claiming that the township had discriminated against the group because of its members' faith. It accused the township of violating a federal law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, by making the organization abide by standards and procedures that the township had not applied to other groups.

The settlements follow a ruling from a federal judge in December that found that the township and its officials had violated the group's rights.

''Bernards Township made decisions that treated the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge differently than other houses of worship,'' William E. Fitzpatrick, the acting United States attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement. ''The settlement announced today corrects those decisions and ensures that members of this religious community have the same ability to practice their faith as all other religions.''

The township will also have to cooperate with the Islamic Society as it applies for the necessary approvals to start construction.

''We look forward to welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds to our mosque,'' Mohammad Ali Chaudry, the president of the Islamic Society, said in a statement. ''Our doors will be open to anyone interested in building bridges to promote harmony in the community and peace in the world.''

The mosque proposal set off an uproar in the community, with public meetings crowded with angry residents. Anti-Muslim sentiments circulated on fliers and in social media posts. The Islamic Society's mailbox was smashed, and a vandal later covered the society's initials on the mailbox, I.S.B.R., with ''ISIS.''

Some critics of the proposal argued that their opposition did not stem from antipathy toward Muslim people but was rooted instead in more practical concerns. In a statement on Tuesday, the township argued that it had a responsibility to ensure that development projects like the mosque ''do not unduly impact others' ability to peacefully and quietly enjoy their own property.''

Legal experts and civil rights groups said it had become increasingly common in recent years for local governments across the country to use zoning laws to try to prevent mosques and Islamic schools from being built. Bridgewater Township, also in Somerset County, agreed in 2014 to pay nearly $8 million to settle a similar case.

A Muslim group filed suit against Bayonne, N.J., last week after a zoning board denied its plans to convert a warehouse into a mosque and community center amid protests like those in Bernards Township. Officials at the United States attorney's office for New Jersey said Tuesday that the Justice Department was investigating the allegations of discrimination.

In Bernards Township, officials maintained that their actions were not discriminatory and said the decision to settle was made to end a yearslong ordeal and reduce the financial risk posed by continuing litigation.

''Bernards Township is a diverse and inclusive community, where for years the I.S.B.R. congregation have practiced their religion along with their neighbors unimpeded,'' Michael P. Turner, a township spokesman, said in a statement.

He noted that the society had assembled in a public community center and park and that Bernards Township had elected Mr. Chaudry, a Pakistani American who has lived there for more than 40 years, as mayor not long after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

The details are eerily familiar: a family outing, a suicide bomber, more than a dozen people —any of them children —illed in an attack later claimed by the Islamic State.

An explosion early Tuesday at an ice cream parlor in Baghdad shared many of the same heart-wrenching characteristics of last week’ attack at an arena in Manchester, England. And that was just the start of the violence on Tuesday in a city where these kinds of terrorist attacks have actually been on the decline this year.

First, the Islamic State targeted the popular Al Faqma shop in the central Karrada neighborhood of Baghdad, where families had gathered to celebrate iftar and break their daylong fast during the holy month of Ramadan.

On most nights during Ramadan, when temperatures can top 100 degrees, families can be found under the shop’ water-misting fans, eating ice cream from wafer cups.

That nightly respite was abruptly ended on Tuesday, just after midnight, when Islamic State militants remotely detonated a car that had been rigged with explosives and parked near the shop, the Iraqi authorities told reporters. Closed-circuit video captured the moment an enormous fireball erupted along a busy thoroughfare.

The bombing killed 17 people and wounded 32 others, according to the authorities. Of the victims, three were children, ages 4, 6 and 8.

“e were expecting to be targeted sooner or later because Karrada had been the favorite area for terrorists to implement their attacks,”aid Mustafa Aljibour, the shop’ manager. “his ice cream shop has been a place for all Iraqis no matter where they are from. It was turned from a very beautiful place into a dark hell.”

Videos posted to social media after the attack show a scene of chaos, with bodies strewn across the shop’ colorful benches. In one, a little girl walks seemingly dazed through the carnage.

Hours later, the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0  or ISIL, struck again at the heart of Baghdad —his time during the evening rush on Tuesday, as people were finishing their shopping before the iftar feasting. Fourteen people were killed and 34 were wounded when a bomb went off outside a government pension office.

Photographs taken after the attack show the charred wreckage of burned-out automobiles and a watermelon seller’ destroyed goods.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks in two posts to a social media channel the group typically uses.

Even as ISIS has lost territory in Iraq, it has increased the intensity of its strikes, often against Shiite civilians. (On Tuesday, the group confirmed that it had chosen its latest targets because they were known gathering places for Shiites.)

Later on Tuesday, as word spread of four more attacks throughout the country, mourners, many of them women, were seen at the sites of the two Baghdad attacks.

Settlements With New Jersey Township Clear Way for Proposed Mosque

A proposed mosque that had been blocked by officials in a New Jersey suburb will now be allowed to move forward after settlements were reached on Tuesday in lawsuits that accused the township of discriminating against Muslims.

Officials in the suburb, Bernards Township in Somerset County, voted last week to agree to the settlements, which will require the township to pay a little more than $3 million.

The township will also have to back down on some of its previous requirements —ncluding a request for more than twice the number of parking spaces originally planned —hich were cited in the lawsuits as complications created to stymie the mosque’ construction. In addition, township officials will have to participate in diversity and inclusion training.

The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge, a Muslim organization in an unincorporated neighborhood in the township, bought a four-acre plot in 2011 in an area where zoning permitted houses of worship. It developed plans to build a mosque of more than 4,000 square feet, with a prayer room large enough for 150 people. The group said it sought to tailor its plans so that the mosque would blend into the neighborhood, forgoing a dome and designing its minarets to look like chimneys and be shorter than the steeples of churches in town.

But after four years, and dozens of public meetings, the township’ planning board denied the society’ application, citing reasons such as storm water management and potential disruption to neighbors.

Last year, the Islamic Society, a 70-member group led by a former township mayor, filed a suit in Federal District Court accusing the township of turning “hat should have been a simple board approval”nto a “afkaesque process.”

Soon after, the United States Justice Department filed its own suit, claiming that the township had discriminated against the group because of its members’aith. It accused the township of violating a federal law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, by making the organization abide by standards and procedures that the township had not applied to other groups.

The settlements follow a ruling from a federal judge in December that found that the township and its officials had violated the group’ rights.

“ernards Township made decisions that treated the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge differently than other houses of worship,”illiam E. Fitzpatrick, the acting United States attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement. “he settlement announced today corrects those decisions and ensures that members of this religious community have the same ability to practice their faith as all other religions.”

The township will also have to cooperate with the Islamic Society as it applies for the necessary approvals to start construction.

“e look forward to welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds to our mosque,”ohammad Ali Chaudry, the president of the Islamic Society, said in a statement. “ur doors will be open to anyone interested in building bridges to promote harmony in the community and peace in the world.”

The mosque proposal set off an uproar in the community, with public meetings crowded with angry residents. Anti-Muslim sentiments circulated on fliers and in social media posts. The Islamic Society’ mailbox was smashed, and a vandal later covered the society’ initials on the mailbox, I.S.B.R., with “ISIS.”

Some critics of the proposal argued that their opposition did not stem from antipathy toward Muslim people but was rooted instead in more practical concerns. In a statement on Tuesday, the township argued that it had a responsibility to ensure that development projects like the mosque “o not unduly impact others’bility to peacefully and quietly enjoy their own property.”

Legal experts and civil rights groups said it had become increasingly common in recent years for local governments across the country to use zoning laws to try to prevent mosques and Islamic schools from being built.

A Muslim group filed suit against Bayonne, N.J., last week after a zoning board denied its plans to convert a warehouse into a mosque and community center amid protests like those in Bernards Township. Another Somerset County municipality, Bridgewater Township, agreed to pay nearly $8 million  to settle a similar case in 2014.

In Bernards Township, officials maintained that their actions were not discriminatory and said the decision to settle was made to end a yearslong ordeal and reduce the financial risk posed by continuing litigation.

“ernards Township is a diverse and inclusive community, where for years the I.S.B.R. congregation have practiced their religion along with their neighbors unimpeded,”ichael P. Turner, a township spokesman, said in a statement.

He noted that the society had assembled in a public community center and park and that Bernards Township had elected Mr. Chaudry, a Pakistani American who has lived there for more than 40 years, as mayor not long after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

“e remain a united township,”r. Turner said, “here all are welcome.”

What to Remember Before Watching ‘ouse of Cards’eason 5

Watching is The New York Times’ TV and movie recommendation site.

Frank Underwood has no intention of ending up a one-term president. Having long ago manipulated his way to the Oval Office, Frank (Kevin Spacey), the ruthless politician at the center of Netflix’ “ouse of Cards,”pent the show’ fourth season on the campaign trail —ith his steely wife, Claire (Robin Wright), as an unlikely running mate. Among the new obstacles thrown into his path to absolute power were an ISIS-like terrorist organization known as “CO,”n assassination attempt that left him critically wounded and a worthy rival for the presidency in the charismatic, media-savvy Republican Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). When the season ended, the election was still three weeks away.

But you could be forgiven for having forgotten all of that. It’ been nearly 15 months (and one exhausting real-life American election cycle) since Netflix released a new batch of “ouse of Cards”pisodes. To jog your memory before Season 5 arrives on Tuesday, May 30, we’e put together a cheat sheet on where the show left every major player at the end of Season 4.

Frank and Claire Underwood

The Underwoods’arriage looked doomed at the beginning of the season, but it really started to turn around after Claire blackmailed Frank into making her his running mate. By the finale, they were working as a team again. When an American ICO cell kidnaps the innocent Miller family and demands the release of their leader, Yusuf al-Ahmadi (Farshad Farahat), the Underwoods attempt to divide and conquer. As Frank negotiates with the terrorists in the War Room, Claire has Ahmadi transported to a government safe house in Virginia, where she talks him into ordering his followers to release the hostages. The terrorists do release the captive mother and daughter in advance of their conversation with Ahmadi, but then the plan backfires. Ahmadi goes off script, ordering his associates to kill the father, James Miller (Sean C. Graham), if they’e captured or if the United States government refuses to set him free.

Meanwhile, when the journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) publishes a damning report on how Frank schemed his way into the White House, it’ Claire who figures out how the Underwoods can recover. “’ done trying to win over people’ hearts,”he tells Frank. Instead, she realizes that they can use the hostage crisis to capitalize on the public’ fears. Frank delivers a terrifying address to the American people, announcing that he’ ramping up the war on terror. Then, he makes sure that as many people as possible are watching —nd that Claire is by his side —hen ICO slits James’ throat in a live video. Frank’ ominous final words of the season: “e don’ submit to terror. We make the terror.”

Will Conway

Introduced as a charming family man, Frank’ Republican rival turns out to be a canny political operator in his own right, matching the Underwoods blow for blow. He faces a bit of a setback when the White House plants a story about his improper interference with the House Intelligence Committee, but that scoop pales in comparison to Hammerschmidt’ subsequent exposéf Frank. After spotting the headline, “nderwood’ Crooked Path to the Oval Office,”onway tells his wife, “ou’e gonna be the next first lady of the United States.”aybe so, but it seems that the poor guy still doesn’ quite understand who he’ up against.

Tom Hammerschmidt

If anyone comes out of the season finale a winner, it’ Tom. Undeterred by Frank’ weak, off-the-record denial of accusations by the House Minority Whip Jackie Sharp (Molly Parker), Frank’ former chief of staff Remy Danton (Mahershala Ali) and the disgraced ex-president Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), he publishes an article that cites all three of them as sources and may still jeopardize the Underwoods’eign. It also, no doubt, places Tom squarely in Frank’ cross hairs.

Doug Stamper

Doug (Michael Kelly), Frank’ creepily loyal Chief of Staff, arranges for a man named Anthony Moretti to die so that Frank can get the emergency liver transplant that saves his life after the assassination attempt. By the end of Season 4, Doug has donated a large sum of money to Anthony’ memorial fund and struck up a tender friendship with his widow, Laura (Wendy Moniz). In the finale, he drives to Laura’ house, where she kisses his hand and tells him to come back to her place after he’ done at the White House. Considering what happened to Doug’ last girlfriend, let’ hope this ill-advised relationship doesn’ get too serious.

Thomas Yates

Claire’ working relationship with Thomas Yates (Paul Sparks), the author who’ writing a book about the Underwoods, blossoms into a Frank-approved affair during the second half of Season 4. But a single scene between Claire and Thomas in the finale hints that her revitalized marriage could supplant their relationship and even, perhaps, get him exiled from the Underwoods’nner circle. When he asks her whether Hammerschmidt’ story is true, she tells him it isn’. “hat’ the first time you’e lied to me since you stopped lying to me,”e says.

Catherine Durant

Once a prime beneficiary of Frank’ scheming, Secretary of State Cathy Durant (Jayne Atkinson) spends much of Season 4 serving in his administration against her will, after her first attempt to take a stand against his corruption ends with a thinly veiled death threat. The finale suggests that she’ starting to become a dangerous liability for the Underwoods. Angry that Frank all but declared war on national television without consulting her first, she greets him in the final, War Room scene with an accusation: “his is your response to the article.”

New York Today: Memorializing, After Memorial Day

Updated, 11:14 a.m.

Good morning on this cloud-cluttered Tuesday.

Welcome back.

With Memorial Day in our rearview mirror, we wonder: What was it like explaining the meaning of the holiday to the young ones in your lives?

While speaking to children about loss, tragedy and commemoration might not be top-of-mind as we gear up for summer, it’ the focus of a recently opened exhibition at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

“ow do you explain what happened to a 6-year-old?”aid Megan Jones, the museum’ director of education programs. She helped create activities that use art to teach children ages 3 to 18 about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks (and, more recently, other tragedies including the Manchester bombing).

“ven those that are 18 now were 3 then, so they really don’ have a memory of it,”he said of the attacks in the United States. “o we spend as much time explaining what the world used to be like before 9/11 as we do on what happened on 9/11.”

The educational program is built around the Cover Stories exhibition, which opened on May 19. It traces the evolution of the Twin Towers on covers of The New Yorker, from almost 50 years ago to the present.

When we explored the exhibition, we saw how illustrations that began as whimsical, lighthearted and fairy tale-like became somber, chilling and politically charged —et still, somehow, poignant and beautiful —fter the tragedy.

As museum guides talk students through the 33 covers, they ask questions: What do you notice? What do you think this is?

For younger children, the lessons focus on firefighters, emergency medical workers, and themes like courage and helping others, Ms. Jones explained.

And for teenagers, the discussions explore the repercussions of the attacks: how Sept. 11 shaped the climate they live in today, one in which the Transportation Security Administration, the Homeland Security Department and metal detectors are the norm.

“e’e trying to help them understand where they fit into this narrative, so we look at current events today and work backward,”s. Jones said. “o we say, ‘ow did 9/11 affect this world that we’e living in?’e’l look at ISIS using social media in recruiting, and at the balance between civil liberties and national security.”

Another new children’ activity, the Art Cart, will open on the outdoor plaza above the museum on June 19. The bright blue stand will be geared toward 6- to 12-year-olds (and their families), with free crafts and science projects that can introduce children to the events of Sept. 11 and bring to life the names of victims they see on the memorial’ parapets.

“hether they’e 18 years old and we’e talking about civil liberties and national security, or we’e talking about heroism and courage from first responders giving back with small children, the idea is to help them see that this isn’ an isolated moment in time,”s. Jones said, “nd to try to help them understand how they fit into it.”

She added, “his history is yours now.”

Here’ what else is happening:

Weather

A sleepy first-day-back from vacation feel, with gray skies and the occasional drizzle.

Today’ high of 65 will slowly inch its way up as the week goes on, but it still won’ feel like summer just yet.

Patience.

Bin Laden Is Gone. His Hydra Thrives.

ANATOMY OF TERROR

From the Death of Bin Laden to the Rise of the Islamic State

By Ali Soufan 359 pages.

W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95.

In his revealing and timely new book, ''Anatomy of Terror,'' the former F.B.I. special agent Ali Soufan compares Al Qaeda and its vicious spinoff, the Islamic State, to the Hydra from Greek mythology: Cut off one head and two more quickly sprout.

More than a decade and a half after Sept. 11, and a half-dozen years after the killing of Osama bin Laden, he writes, ''the cancer of bin Ladenism has metastasized across the Middle East and North Africa and beyond, carried by even more virulent vectors.''

''Whereas on 9/11 Al Qaeda had around 400 members,'' he goes on, ''today it has thousands upon thousands, in franchises and affiliates spread from the shores of the Pacific to Africa's Atlantic seaboard.'' And he notes that bin Laden's 20-something son Hamza -- who ''grew up with a fervor for jihad and a determination to follow'' in his father's footsteps -- is ''being prepared for leadership'' with several of his father's most trusted lieutenants. Meanwhile, the Islamic State has brought mass murder to Iraq and Syria, and conducted or inspired attacks in more than two dozen countries; the group claimed responsibility for last week's deadly bombing in Manchester, England.

As he did in his best-selling 2011 book, ''The Black Banners,'' Soufan writes with immense knowledge and authority. He was the lead investigator of the bombing of the American destroyer Cole and a supervisor of counterterrorism operations and the investigation of events surrounding Sept. 11. He was instrumental in identifying the Sept. 11 hijackers and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed as the architect of those attacks, and he extracted such crucial information not by torture or ''enhanced interrogation techniques'' (E.I.T.s), but by building a rapport with his subjects, sparring with them over interpretations of the Quran, and using old-fashioned logic and psychology.

Soufan, who left the F.B.I. in 2005, has been an outspoken critic of the Bush administration's so-called E.I.T.s, arguing that torture is both morally wrong and ineffective and dangerous -- generating false leads and unreliable information, and helping terrorists find new recruits.

In ''The Black Banners,'' Soufan provided a compelling insider's account of American efforts to track down the perpetrators of Sept. 11, and recounted the story of Al Qaeda up through the death of bin Laden. His new book covers some of the same ground, but focuses on that terrorist group after bin Laden's death, and how it and the Islamic State have evolved since -- their different philosophies and divergent trajectories, and how the personalities of their leaders have shaped the organizations. Of the relationship between the soft-spoken bin Laden and Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the fiery militant who founded the group that would become the Islamic State, Soufan quotes an intelligence officer: It was a case of ''loathing at first sight.''

Much of this has been covered in books like ''Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS'' by Joby Warrick, ''ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror'' by Michael Weiss and Hassan Hassan, and ''ISIS: The State of Terror'' by Jessica Stern and J. M. Berger. But Soufan brings firsthand, on-the-ground experience hunting down and interrogating Qaeda members. ''Anatomy of Terror'' not only tells a gripping story but is filled with insights that put today's terror attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in perspective with the history and complicated geopolitics of the region.

Soufan underscores the disastrous role that the United States invasion of Iraq and its bungled occupation played in fueling terrorism, creating chaos and a power vacuum in Iraq -- the perfect incubator for insurgent violence and bloodshed. Two calamitous decisions made by the Americans (dissolving the Iraqi Army and banning members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party from positions of authority) would prove fateful. Soufan writes that embittered and unemployed ''former Baathists soon became the backbone of the new Islamic State of Iraq.'' He adds, ''With their governmental, intelligence, and military experience, these men made themselves essential both to ISI's battlefield achievements and to the terror tactics it has deployed against ordinary citizens.''

He lucidly describes the nefarious modus operandi (borrowed, in part, from Hussein's regime) by which ISI -- which would be renamed ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) or ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), and later simply IS, the Islamic State -- began aggressively conquering territory in Iraq and Syria in 2013. It would start, in each town, by opening what appeared to be a religious community center, then selecting fervent young men ''to inform on their neighbors and spy on any rival rebel groups in the area.''

While gathering intelligence and blackmail material on residents, Soufan explains: ''ISIL would begin concentrating its fighters in the area -- typically foreigners who would have less compunction about killing or subjugating the natives. When the local faction judged that it had amassed enough manpower and enough leverage with the local population, it would go public and seize the municipal government, violently if necessary.'' Leaders of rival groups would be assassinated, and anyone who opposed ISIL's rule would be killed -- terror tactics that compelled allegiance from local tribes.

In other chapters, Soufan gives a detailed portrait of Al Qaeda's more bureaucratic operation, describing bin Laden's long view of history and his penchant for micromanagement. (''Please send me the réumé of all the brothers who might be nominated for high administrative positions now or in the future.'')

Such passages give a keen sense of how these terrorist groups operate day to day. Soufan also uses some of the techniques he learned as an interrogator to get inside the heads of his subjects, mapping the factors that lead many to become jihadis, and the ways Al Qaeda and the Islamic State use publicity and propaganda to recruit members and promote their brand.

''Know your enemy,'' he quotes Sun Tzu, adding that empathy is a useful tool in this war -- ''not in the colloquial sense of sharing another person's perspective, but in the clinical sense of being able to see the world through another person's eyes.'' By understanding Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, he writes, we can better ''combat the destructive ideology they represent.''

Philippine Forces Struggle to Retake City Held by Islamist Militants

MARAWI, Philippines —ilitants loyal to the Islamic State stubbornly resisted as government troops pushed on Monday to drive them out of Marawi, a city in the southern Philippines where hundreds of desperate residents remained trapped by the fighting.

Troops have so far cleared about half the city of militants from the Abu Sayyaf and Maute groups and the foreign fighters backing them, but the insurgents have broken up into small groups and have proved elusive, according to Zia Alonto Adiong, a spokesman for the Lanao del Sur provincial government.

The military’ struggle to drive out the rebels has become a major challenge for the government of President Rodrigo Duterte, who declared martial law in the region last week and vowed to defeat the insurgents.

There were signs that the battle was turning into a siege. Mr. Alonto said the province had imposed a nightly curfew and called on civilians to help the military fight and subdue the militants.

“overnment forces are allowing citizens’rrests,”e told reporters in Marawi. “e are calling on those who can to help us.”

As he spoke, helicopters on bombing runs circled above the city, which once bustled with a population of 200,000. It is now nearly a ghost town, with little other than intermittent bursts of gunfire to break the eerie silence.

The crisis appears to be spilling over to the nearby city of Iligan, where people fleeing the fighting have taken refuge while fearing that insurgents could be hiding among them.

“ligan City is now overflowing, crowded, because it is the choke point, the gateway in and out of Marawi,”aid Col. Alex Aduca, an army infantry commander. “he terrorists are trying to withdraw, and those who can leave might attempt to enter Iligan by disguising themselves as evacuees,”e said. “e are carefully screening everyone, including evacuees, to make sure none of the rebels gets past us in disguise.”

As government forces focused on driving the rebels from Marawi, they also escorted dozens of civilians from the city using armored personnel carriers and military trucks mounted with machine guns.

As of Monday, 61 militants, 20 government troops and 19 civilians had died in the fighting, according to the military and government authorities. Sixteen of those civilians were found dead on Sunday, some dumped into a ravine and others near a university. Volunteers said casualty numbers were likely to increase because there were probably many bodies in places that had yet to be reached.

Hostilities erupted last week when the military and the police moved to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, the Islamic State’ anointed leader in the Philippines and head of an Abu Sayyaf faction. They were met by a force of about 100 militant fighters, including heavily armed insurgents from the allied Maute group. The military has said that militants from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore were also among those taking part in the clashes.

The Maute fighters quickly took over much of the city, burning a cathedral and a hospital and kidnapping a Roman Catholic priest and several people whose fates remained unknown. They then spread out of the city, engaging troops in running gun battles.

The army had hoped to finish off the rebels quickly, but the militants mixed in among Marawi’ inhabitants, complicating government efforts to subdue them and rescue trapped citizens. Officials called on civilians to wear white or tie on white ribbons to indicate they were noncombatants.

“here are many people stranded inside the areas where we believe fighters are still roaming,”aid Saripada Pacasum, the deputy of the provincial disaster council.

“hree women were texting us in the hotline from their basement. One said, ‘here are I.S. fighters inside our home,’”e said, referring to the Islamic State. “e told them to just hide and be silent.”

“e never heard back from them,”e added. “e have no word on the priest and the hostages.”

He added that some trapped civilians had called on the military “o stop the bombardment so that food and water could be brought in.”

On Monday, the atmosphere in Marawi was tense, with constant explosions sending evacuees into a panic. Evacuees also had to pass through checkpoints at several roadblocks to leave the city. Some were asked to submit to strip searches by government troops.

“e just want to join our relatives in Iligan,”aid Norhayda Aziz, 23. “his place has been forsaken.”

On the road to Iligan, about 200 people, including children, were asked to get out of their vehicles and pass through a security checkpoint.

As the crisis has deepened, political opponents have called on Mr. Duterte not to use it as a pretext for strengthening his grip on the country. Mr. Duterte said last week that he might impose martial law on the whole country to stop the Islamist threat.

“o one is above the law, not even the president,”aid Senator Francis Pangilinan, an opposition leader. “e oppose any violation of the Constitution on matters pertaining to the martial law declaration. To allow the president to disregard the Constitution is to open the gates to dictatorship.”

CORRECTION APPENDEDOne morning in mid-December, a group of soldiers banged on the door of a house in eastern Aleppo. A male voice responded from inside: ''Who are you?'' A soldier answered: ''We're the Syrian Arab Army. It's O.K., you can come out. They're all gone.''

The door opened. A middle-aged man appeared. He had a gaunt, distinguished face, but his clothes were threadbare and his teeth looked brown and rotted. At the soldiers' encouragement, he stepped hesitantly forward into the street. He explained to them, a little apologetically, that he had not crossed his threshold in four and a half years.

The man gazed around for a moment as if baffled, his eyes filling with tears. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad had just recaptured the city after years of bombing and urban warfare that had made Aleppo a global byword for savagery. This frail-looking man had survived at the war's geographic center entirely alone, an urban Robinson Crusoe, living on stocks of dry food and whatever he could grow in his small inner courtyard. Now, as he stumbled through an alley full of twisted metal and rubble, he saw for the first time that the front lines, marked by a wall of sandbags, were barely 20 yards from his house.

Three months later, in March, he sat with me under the tall, spindly orange tree in his courtyard and described how he barricaded himself in when the fighting started. He goes by the name Abu Sami, and he has the mild, patient manners of a scholar; he taught at Aleppo University before the war. In the early days of the rebel takeover, he said, his nephews used to drop by with fresh bread and meat. But starting in 2013, the shelling grew worse, and he would go six months or more without seeing another human face. There was no water, no electric light; he gathered rainwater in buckets and boiled it and used a small solar panel to charge his phone. He made vinegar from grapes he grew in the courtyard. He treated his illnesses with aloe and other herbs he grew in pots. Once, when a rotten tooth became too painful, he yanked it out with pliers. He cowered by his bed when bombs shook the house to its foundation.

Most of all, he sustained himself by reading. He carried out a stack of books from his bedroom to show me: treatises by Sigmund Freud, novels by Henry Miller, histories of science and psychology and religion and mythology and cooking, a book on radical theater by the American drama critic Robert Brustein. Some were in Russian, a language he learned as a young man. ''I read these things so I wouldn't have to think about politics or current events,'' he said. He read plays -- Shakespeare and Molièe were favorites -- and in his solitude, he found that he was able to see the entire drama acted out in his mind, as if it were onstage.

He led me upstairs to see his dusty study, where the walls and ceiling were shredded with dozens of small shrapnel holes that let in fingers of sunlight. He picked up a bomb fragment, rolled it in his palm and laughed. He pointed to the house next door, where his neighbor, a quiet man who kept pigeons on the roof, had lived until a group of rebels arrived, shouting, and dragged him from the door. They brought back his corpse half an hour later.

I asked Abu Sami why he never left. He gave the same answer that so many others gave me: because it was his house. And because day after day, year after year, he kept thinking, Surely this war is about to end.

In the eastern Aleppo streets beyond Abu Sami's house, little has changed since the December morning when he rediscovered his ruined city. A narrow alley leads to an open area where a ''hell cannon'' still sits, the homemade howitzer used by rebels to fire on government-controlled western Aleppo. Beyond it, there are buildings with pancaked roofs, evidence of Russian and Syrian bombs. There are piles of rubble so high that entire streets remain impassable. Throughout the former rebel zone that once proudly called itself ''free Aleppo,'' there are hospitals and schools and houses -- it goes on for miles -- that have been reduced to uneven heaps of stone and broken concrete, where the faint smell of buried corpses still lingers.

In the United States, the drawn-out siege of Aleppo -- where the Syrian regime and its Russian allies repeatedly bombed hospitals and civilian areas -- was widely deplored as a war crime comparable to the worst massacres of the Bosnian war during the 1990s. The refusal to intervene, some said, was a defining moral failure of the Obama administration. On the other side, regime supporters saw only the rebels' atrocities and their manipulation of civilians for propaganda. The ''fall'' of Aleppo, they said, was really the ''liberation'' of a city from terrorist rule, and a sign that Assad had all but won the civil war.

Both portraits are false and self-serving. The Syrian tragedy started in a moment of deceptive simplicity, when the peaceful protesters of the 2011 Arab Spring seemed destined to inherit the future. Chants for freedom turned quickly to insurrection, bullets and war. But it took some time for outsiders to recognize how different Syria was, how its internal schisms -- like tightly coiled springs -- would provoke the fears and ambitions of all its neighbors. The Saudis and Turks wanted to replace Assad with a reliable Sunni client, while Iran and Hezbollah held fast to their one foothold in the Arab world. Russia, which intervened decisively in 2015, had its own motives: flouting American designs and protecting a reliable autocrat. The United States, having expected Assad to fall on his own, dithered over support for the rebels.

Aleppo became the rebels' last major urban redoubt. Its fall reconfigured the Syrian battleground: The Saudis and Turks resigned themselves to Assad's rule, and their rivals exulted in a victory that seemed to justify years of blood and treasure. The Assad regime happily stepped out of the limelight as the world's attention turned back to capturing Raqqa, the ISIS capital in Syria's northeast.

One small measure of the regime's confidence was a renewed willingness to let Western journalists -- including me -- travel the country. I was under the usual police-state surveillance, with a minder from the Information Ministry accompanying me during my travels outside Damascus. But scarcely any Americans had been to Aleppo since the regime's victory in December. The city had become a symbol of sorts, a sprawling commercial hub where every faction seemed to have left its mark. I had been trying to get back there for years; it was a place I loved when I covered the region from Beirut. I wanted to wind back the clock and make sense of how a city that seemed so averse to politics -- of any kind -- had been torn apart.

Even Syrians have trouble answering that question. In March, I met a lawyer named Anas Joudeh, who took part in some of the 2011 protests. Joudeh no longer considers himself a member of the opposition. I asked him why. ''No one is 100 percent with the regime, but mostly these people are unified by their resistance to the opposition,'' Joudeh told me. ''They know what they don't want, not what they want.'' In December, he said, ''Syrians abroad who believe in the revolution would call me and say, 'We lost Aleppo.' And I would say, 'What do you mean?' It was only a Turkish card guarded by jihadis.'' For these exiled Syrians, he said, the specter of Assad's crimes looms so large that they cannot see anything else. They refuse to acknowledge the realities of a rebellion that is corrupt, brutal and compromised by foreign sponsors. This is true. Eastern Aleppo may not have been Raqqa, where ISIS advertised its rigid Islamist dystopia and its mass beheadings. But as a symbol of Syria's future, it was almost as bad: a chaotic wasteland full of feuding militias -- some of them radical Islamists -- who hoarded food and weapons while the people starved.

As for the regime's victory there, it probably would not have taken place if Turkey had not withdrawn some of its rebel proxies to focus on fighting the Kurds. Aleppo may have helped the regime's morale, but the war is likely to grind on for years, sustained and manipulated by outside powers. Assad needs them: His army has been decimated by war and desertions. That may help explain his use of chemical weapons in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in early April, which prompted the Trump administration's slap-on-the-wrist missile strike. With his manpower running out, Assad cares more about reinforcing his rule -- at any cost -- than rehabilitating his reputation in the West, which might have provided loans to help rebuild his shattered country.

All the same, Aleppo was a turning point, and in some ways an emblem of the wider war. Its fall appears to have persuaded many ordinary Syrians that the regime, for all its appalling cruelty and corruption, is their best shot at something close to normality. This is almost certainly true for the Trump administration too. President Trump may call Assad an ''animal'' and hint at more airstrikes, but he cannot unseat him, because he knows that the alternative is not the kinder, gentler place once dreamed of by opposition activists. It is anarchy, where the warlords rule not from the presidential palace but from every town and every street.

First they stole everything, then they burned everything,'' Freddy Marrache told me as I stumbled along in the darkness behind him. Above us were vaulted medieval stone roofs, interrupted here and there by huge shell holes. ''This was the spice market -- it's totally gone. The front line was just here.'' Underfoot was a slurry of ash and garbage. Marrache, a 48-year-old businessman with a pale, shaved head and an air of quiet alertness, made frequent visits as a child to Aleppo's Old City. The souqs were its crown jewel, a cloacal maze of market stalls packed with spices, fabrics, silks, leather, soaps, gold, meat, fruit, carpets, toilet seats -- almost anything. It went on for more than eight miles, one of the largest covered markets in the world. Aleppans used to say that a blind man could find his way through them by following the smells of the merchandise. Then, in 2012, the rebels came, and the souqs became the perfect refuge for urban guerrillas.

Marrache and his sister, Marie-Michelle, had offered to show me the remains of the Khan al Nahassine, a grand old house attached to the souqs that was built in 1539 and has been owned by their family since the 1800s. I first saw it a decade earlier, when their mother, Jenny Poche Marrache, walked me through it. She was then in her 60s, and she had a sour elegance that seemed to match the place. I remember her complaining about Islamists as she chain-smoked and concluding acidly in French, ''Soon I'll be dead, and it won't matter.'' She waited patiently as I stared at the parade of antiquities on every wall: paintings, sculptures, documents, old musical instruments, photographs. That house was a shrine to the old Levantine world of which Aleppo -- with its polyglot traders, its mix of Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam -- had been the center. Jenny died in 2015, before she could see the extent of the damage to the house.

Everything was gone. Even the copper wiring had been stripped out. The walls were still there, but on the far side some rooms had collapsed into the courtyard after heavy shelling. ''You remember the painting that was here?'' Freddy asked. I did. It was of a woman in Renaissance dress, the wife of the first Venetian consul in Aleppo. (Aleppo still has honorary consulships for many European countries.) The painting was memorable because it was painted in the same room where it hung; you could recognize the other objects and the shape of the wall. Freddy explained that the painting had turned up in Turkey, like much of what the rebels had stolen across Aleppo. An Istanbul antiques dealer told them that he would sell it back to them for $20,000. When they protested that it was stolen, Freddy told me, the dealer said dismissively, ''I get things from Syria every day.''

Back in the souqs, I kept trying to superimpose my memories of the place. We passed near the silk merchants' area, now blackened and silent. Before 2011, I used to stop there and visit a flamboyant young trader with a round, cherubic face. He would give me tea and drape me with scarves. His little stall was covered with pictures of gay icons like Judy Garland, a reference that his Syrian partners seemed not to get (or perhaps they just didn't care). I still have his business card, with a picture of Oscar Wilde and the quote: ''I can resist everything except temptation.'' Aleppo in those days was a magnet for footloose journalists and adventure tourists. We would spend hours getting lost in the souqs and then stop for drinks in the dimly lit bar at the Hotel Baron, gazing at its old unpaid bar tab left by T.E. Lawrence, our heads swimming with nostalgia for an era we knew only from books.

Now parts of the city were literally unrecognizable. In al-Hatab Square, once one of the prettier spots in the Old City, I found only a giant, uneven mound of rubble and earth that rose 15 feet above the street, with grass growing in it. I almost stepped on an unexploded Turkish gas bomb surrounded by yellow spring flowers. On the square's edges, half the buildings were destroyed. It was hard to believe this was once an orderly urban setting, lined with restaurants and hotels. The last time I was in Aleppo, in late 2010, I stayed at a beautiful old boutique hotel near the square, the Beit Wakil. I remember the owner taking me down into a dark, earthen-walled subbasement to show me a network of tunnels built centuries earlier. You could travel all the way to the citadel -- the great medieval palace that towers over the Old City -- without going aboveground, he said. They were built during the 17th century, when intermittent wars often made streets too treacherous to walk. ''Perhaps we will need them again,'' he said.

What destroyed Aleppo? It was not the sectarianism that is often held up as a key to the Syrian war. It was not just ''terrorism,'' the word used by regime apologists to fend off any share of blame. Those things played a role, but the core of the conflict in Aleppo, as in much of Syria, was a divide between urban wealth and rural poverty. It is not new. Travelers in the Ottoman era used to describe the shocking gulf between Aleppo's opulence and the countryside surrounding it, where peasants lived in almost Stone Age conditions. Later, this divide mapped onto the city itself, as eastern Aleppo spread and filled with poor migrants. Deeply religious and mostly illiterate, smoldering with class resentment, they became the foot soldiers of a violent insurgency led by the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1970s. That rebellion burned for years and culminated in the Syrian regime's notorious massacre of 10,000 to 30,000 people in the city of Hama in 1982. Hundreds of people were killed in Aleppo, too, and a siege atmosphere marked the entire city. The Syrian novelist Khaled Khalifa, who grew up in Aleppo during those years and wrote a novel about it, told me in 2008 that the city's cosmopolitan traditions had helped protect it. But he added: ''All this has harmed Syrian society so much. If what happened in the 1980s were to happen again, I think the Islamists would win.''

One tragedy of Aleppo is that this rift between rich and poor was slowly mending in the years just before the 2011 uprisings. An economic renaissance was underway, fueled by thousands of small factories on the city's outskirts. The workers were mostly from eastern Aleppo, and the owners from the west. A trade deal with Turkey, whose border is just 30 miles to the north, brought new business and tourists and optimism. I remember sitting at cafe table with two Turkish traders just outside the citadel in late 2009. Tourists thronged all around us, and the two men talked excitedly about how new joint ventures were melting the animosity between their country and Syria. ''Erdogan and Assad, they are like real friends,'' one of them said, referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.

This kind of optimism was one reason the revolution took so long to reach Aleppo. All through 2011, as the rest of Syria erupted in protest, its largest city was quiet. But by 2012, in the villages just beyond the city's edges, weaponry was flowing in from across the Turkish border and battalions were being formed. ''The countryside was boiling,'' I was told by Adnan Hadad, an opposition activist who was there at the time and belonged to the Revolutionary Military Council in Aleppo, a group led by Syrian military officers who defected. The council was eager for more European and American recognition and sensitive to Western calls for the preservation of most of Syria's state institutions. But local rural people tended to side with a more Islamist and less patient group called Liwa al-Tawheed. Tawheed's members ''considered themselves more authentic'' and had begun getting their own funding from Persian Gulf donors, Hadad told me. In the spring of 2012, Tawheed's members began pushing for a military takeover of Aleppo, accusing the council of excessive caution and even secret deals with the regime. The council resisted, saying they should move only when it was clear that the city's people wanted them to. In July, Tawheed took matters into its own hands. Armed insurgents flooded eastern and southwestern parts of the city, taking over civilian houses as well as police stations in the name of the revolution. Hadad considered the move a ''fatal mistake,'' he told me, and resigned from the military council.

By then, eastern Aleppo had become a rebel stronghold. In early 2013, elections for provincial councils took place, giving the rebels a civilian veneer. But the councils, initially funded by the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, were soon under pressure from the Nusra Front, the Syrian Qaeda affiliate, and other hard-line groups. Later, ISIS forces captured parts of the city and forced residents to live by their rigid code. In theory, Aleppo was an embattled showplace for the Syrian revolution's aspirations. In fact, most civilians were dependent on a patchwork of armed rebel factions for food and protection. The constant pressure of war left almost no room for a real economy, and many of the city's factories had been repurposed by the rebels as military bases.

Now Aleppo's great economic engine lies in ruins. One afternoon, a 45-year-old factory owner named Ghassan Nasi took me to the industrial area just west of Aleppo called Layramoon. The sounds of the city dissipated as we drove west, and when the car stopped, there was an eerie silence. An entire district that once hummed with 1,000 small factories was now abandoned, most of its buildings shattered and burned. ''It is a 100 percent loss here,'' Nasi said. We walked down a dusty street to his factory, a textile and dyeing house that employed 130 people who worked 24 hours a day in three shifts. The door still had its metal filigree gate and marble steps. ''This is where workers stamped in and out,'' he said.

Inside, the huge factory floor was burned black and strewn with rubble. The rebels had used it to make weapons, he said. His old office had been used to house prisoners. Nasi told me quietly that he collapsed to his knees upon seeing it again last summer. ''I lost $10 million in machinery, $4 million in land,'' he said. ''Even if we rebuild, the machinery is gone, and with the sanctions, we cannot buy new machinery.'' On top of that, there is inflation: The American dollar was worth 47 Syrian pounds before the crisis, and now it trades unofficially at about 520. And Turkey -- where much of the Aleppo factories' machinery was transported and sold, often with the collusion of Syrian owners who wanted to avoid losing everything -- now sells similar textiles for less. Reviving Syrian industry, and the social glue it might once have provided, is next to impossible.

I asked Nasi what had become of his workers. He said about 70 percent of them joined the rebels. He didn't seem bitter or surprised about this. Some lived nearby, so when the area was divided, they had little choice. As for the others, they were poor and ill educated and religious, and the rebels promised them a lot. ''The average salary for workers was about a hundred dollars a week,'' he said. ''The rebels paid more.''

For many Aleppans, caught up in a conflict they had tried to avoid, the only rule was survival. On a warm spring morning in 2013, a 22-year-old man named Yasser lay bleeding in the middle of a street in eastern Aleppo. Moments earlier, he had carried his mother, mortally wounded by a sniper, into his grandparents' car. As he watched the car pull away, three bullets struck his legs and left arm. He collapsed into the street and could not move. Shots rang out over his head: regime soldiers trading fire with rebels on either side of him. The soldiers heard Yasser calling for help and told him to come toward them. ''I can't move,'' he shouted. Then a rebel spoke from a nearby building, promising to help. When he answered, a regime soldier called out, ''Who are you talking to?'' The rebels quickly warned him not to answer or they would kill him.

''I was very scared of both sides,'' Yasser told me later. ''If I went to one side, the other would kill me.'' He lay there, his limbs going numb, too frightened to move or speak for more than four hours.

I met Yasser in March in Sha'ar, the most devastated neighborhood in eastern Aleppo. He was short and solidly built, with a snub nose and a gruff manner. He was selling tomatoes and cucumbers from a stand, on a block where many buildings were in ruins. Across the street was a fruit stand, and next to it, a loud generator, set up by the government to supply electricity. Surprising numbers of people walked the streets. This place had been almost completely empty a few weeks earlier, but now that Russian mine-clearing teams had been through and the rubble was mostly pushed aside, Sha'ar's residents were returning to their homes. (More than 100,000 went back to eastern Aleppo between January and March, according to the International Organization for Migration.) Yasser said he was one of the first people to come back, right after what he -- like everyone else I met -- called the liberation. It was a gesture of defiance, aimed at the rebels. ''What we lost, we will get it back,'' he said. He wore military fatigues, and he told me he re-enlisted in the military after he got out of the hospital in 2013. ''My blood type is O-Assad,'' he said.

Later, Yasser showed me the place where he was wounded. It was the first time he'd been back since it happened, and the block had changed, like most of eastern Aleppo. ''There was a checkpoint here, there were sandbags there,'' he said. He pointed out the first-floor window where an old man had talked to him through curtains as he lay on the street. He showed me the building where he thought the sniper had been hiding, about 100 yards away. He explained how his ordeal had ended: An airstrike hit the building, and the sniper vanished. A man on a motorbike rescued Yasser, carrying him to a house, where someone cleaned his wounds. Later, he was taken to a hospital, where a doctor told him that his mother was dead. The doctor put a needle in his arm and told him to count to three, and he blacked out.

I found Yasser's story credible, and his uncle later backed it up. But as I stood on the street with him, I found myself wondering: Did he really know who shot him? Bullets were coming from each side. As he lay there bleeding, whom was he more frightened of -- the rebels or the regime? Yasser clearly knew how his government is portrayed in the West and seemed defensive about it. He told me a rebel group tried to blame the regime for his mother's death. Later, he said, the same group admitted its guilt and offered blood money, which the family refused to take. This seemed less plausible. He walked me down the street to his uncle's house, where he said we would hear another story about what the rebels had done.

Yasser's uncle was a big, heavyset man with a jowly face and a look of weary resignation in his eyes. He welcomed us into his tiny apartment, where he offered me a stool and sat down on his old brass bed. He sighed and apologized for being unable to offer us tea. Then he showed us his scarred arm and told us the story of how his family was devastated in January 2013. He was driving his pregnant daughter to the hospital when machine-gun fire riddled the car, killing his wife instantly and wounding everyone else. He told me rebels from the Free Syrian Army pulled them from the car and rushed them to a nearby hospital. I asked who fired on them. ''I don't know,'' he said.

There was a silence. Until that moment, I had not heard anyone miss an opportunity to blame the rebels. With my government minder looking on, Yasser began asking where the gunfire had come from. Wasn't it from a tall building nearby? Weren't the rebels in that building? The uncle shrugged. ''I don't know,'' he said again. I had the impression that he was profoundly depressed and past caring about what he was supposed to say. Yasser kept pressing. Eventually, the uncle caved in and said, Sure, it was probably the rebels. ''My wife died a martyr,'' he said. ''For the F.S.A., I cannot say, because they helped me and my wife. I cannot say how they are with other people.'' And then quietly, he began to cry.

There is a billboard hanging over one of Aleppo's main intersections that shows a soldier wearing a helmet, with his entire face shrouded in shadow. Beneath it are the words ''Aleppo in Our Eyes.'' The image stuck with me. Which Aleppo? Whose eyes? In Arabic, the expression conveys affection, but the words also seemed to hint at the city's fragmented loyalties, its atmosphere of enduring suspicion. It wasn't just regime allegiance that made people like Yasser tailor their stories. He refused to be photographed, and when I asked why, he hinted that the rebels might still be able to find and kill him, even after the regime's triumph. Another man described receiving a visit at his home in government-controlled Aleppo from two ISIS members, who calmly blackmailed him and went on their way, unhurried. The city had changed hands so many times that no one could be fully confident whose eyes would be watching them.

On my second day in the city, I went to see the Aleppo Eye Hospital, a sprawling compound that the rebels had used as a military headquarters. As we walked through the burned and shattered building, my government minder and the soldiers guarding the place kept picking up markers of the rebels' Islamist leanings. They weren't hard to find. A fire-blackened car out front still had the Qaeda logo on its hood. Inside, the rebels had put up paper signs to show how they used the rooms: a room where Shariah rulings were handed out by a religious sheikh, a document about Islamic punishments. There was a prison too, and I later met a woman who seems to have been kept there. She had been captured in a rural village, and the rebels killed her husband and then moved her from place to place, intending to trade her for their own prisoners. There were female jailers who beat and cursed her and called her an infidel. She told me she was given a bottle of water to wash herself with once every 10 to 15 days. During the final battle for Aleppo, she often heard the sounds of bombs and mortars exploding nearby, and her jailers would taunt her, saying Assad's bombs will kill you.

As I walked through those ruins, it was clear enough that the rebels who ruled eastern Aleppo had done some awful things there. Yet the whole hospital tour was designed, at least in part, to mitigate or obscure a very uncomfortable fact. The Assad regime repeatedly and deliberately bombed hospitals in the rebel zone, even when there was no reason to suspect that fighters were based there. No one would discuss this with me during my time in Aleppo, even when I did not have the minder with me. Instead, I had to speak to people who fled eastern Aleppo under the terms of the deal to evacuate the city in December, when the regime recaptured it. They were living in Idlib province, to the southwest, which is held by rebels, and I spoke to them by Skype. One was a young man who worked as a nurse at the Omar bin Abdul Aziz Hospital throughout 2016. He told me that the hospital was rendered inoperable 15 times by regime airstrikes. Each time, engineers and doctors would rehabilitate it, only to see it damaged again. When the regime soldiers got too close, they moved to another hospital, called Al Quds. It was so crowded that they sometimes tended the wounded in the street outside.

Stories like this have been amply documented and held up as evidence that the Assad regime is guilty of war crimes on a wide scale. A nongovernmental organization in Europe has been working for years to gather documents that would tie the Syrian leadership to these crimes in a Nuremberg-style trial. That prospect is remote, but there are signs that Assad, too, may be worried about whose eyes are watching him. This month, the State Department released satellite photographs suggesting that the regime is burning the bodies of executed prisoners in a crematory at the Sednaya prison complex, north of Damascus, in an alleged effort to hide evidence. The Syrian regime called these charges a ''new Hollywood plot.''

One afternoon, I was sitting in an Aleppo cafe with a 26-year-old man who had just got out of the army after six years. He served all over the country and had shrapnel wounds on his legs and back. His cellphone rang, and I watched his eyes widen as he absorbed what was obviously bad news. When he got off the phone, he told me that six friends from his old unit had just been killed in Jobar, a suburb of Damascus. The rebels had launched a complex attack using tunnels and multiple suicide bombers. All in all, about 30 regime soldiers had been killed. That attack was the start of a rebel offensive that reached the edge of Damascus's Old City, keeping residents awake much of the night with deafening blasts. The rebels mounted simultaneous assaults to the north, forcing the roads to close for days. I had my own minor brush with the rebel campaign. As I was driving from Aleppo to the Syrian coast, rebels opened fire on the road to our right as we passed near the city of Homs. A soldier yelled at us to move fast, and our driver gunned the engine -- we must have hit 100 miles an hour on a tiny two-way road -- and told us to duck our heads. The rebels were just a hundred yards away. I heard their shellfire thumping in the distance almost everywhere I went.

It is impossible to live in government-controlled Syria without noticing that there are almost no young men on the street. They are in the army, or they are dead. Veterans must carry their military papers with them or risk on-the-spot re-enlistment. At one checkpoint, government soldiers tried to grab the young Spanish photographer I was working with, who is easily mistaken for a Syrian; they wanted to recruit him. In Latakia, a beach town in the regime's northwestern heartland, I met a 53-year-old businessman named Munzer Nasser, who commands a militia composed almost entirely of older men; there are no young men left in his village. One of its members, he told me, is a 65-year-old whose three sons have all been killed in the war. Behind the Assad regime's atrocities lies a fear of demographic exhaustion. Its rebel opponents have no such worries: They can draw on a vast well of Islamist sympathizers across the Arab world.

These facts translate into a genuine gratitude -- in regime-controlled areas -- toward Russia, whose military intervention in late 2015 may have forestalled a total collapse. Many Syrians say they feel reassured by the sight of Russian soldiers, because they (unlike the army and its allied militias) are not likely to loot or steal. Some of my contacts in regime-controlled areas are even learning Russian. In Latakia, some people told me that their city might have been destroyed if not for the Russians. The city has long been one of Syria's safe zones, well defended by the army and its militias; there are tent cities full of people who have fled other parts of the country, including thousands from Aleppo. But in the summer of 2015, the rebels were closing in on the Latakia city limits, and mortars were falling downtown. If the rebels had captured the area -- where Alawites are the majority -- a result would almost certainly have been sectarian mass murder. Many people in the region would have blamed the United States, which armed some of the rebels operating in the area. In this sense, the Russian intervention was a lucky thing for the Obama administration too. Andrew Exum, who worked in the Pentagon at the time, told me that the military drew up contingency plans for a rapid collapse of the regime. The planning sessions were talked about as ''catastrophic success.''

Yet Assad's popularity is due not only to his role as the guarantor of a secular order. He has also cannily positioned himself as a unique guardian against his own regime. Just before I arrived in Aleppo in March, a high-ranking Republican Guard commander in the city issued a public order declaring a crackdown on ''acts of looting, robbery and assaults on public property and on the freedoms of citizens and their private property.'' The order was a belated recognition of what had been going on for months: an orgy of looting by the various paramilitary groups that work alongside the Syrian Army, and even by elements of the army itself.

I heard complaints about this everywhere I went. Looting has become so common that it has generated a new word: ta'feesh, to steal furniture. One reporter for the regime-friendly TV channel Al Mayadeen said in a November interview that ''this systematic looting has exceeded all limits to include murder as well as stealing and looting.'' He went on to describe a ''rigorously organized'' process in which the paramilitary groups followed the Syrian Army and pillaged at will, sometimes ''dragging homeowners from their houses and robbing the houses right in front of their eyes.'' Another common tactic, he said, was to pour gasoline on walls and set a fire ''until the tiles on the floors and walls expand due to the heat. Then they put out the fire, remove the tiles and resell them.''

The reporter, an Aleppan named Rida al-Basha, described the neighborhoods where this had taken place and named the militias, including the notorious Tiger Forces, whose leaders include well-known thugs. At the end of the interview, Basha said that he had pleaded with the city government and other journalists to expose these crimes, but that everyone was too frightened. After the report, Basha repeatedly said he was threatened with death, and he is said to have fled the country.

Publicly, the Syrian state deplores these crimes, but privately it seems to condone them as a form of compensation for the paramilitary groups, whose support Assad needs to supplement his decimated army. (The rebels do it, too, and sometimes offer an Islamic justification: ghana'im al-harb, the spoils of war.) Only when the looting starts to spin out of control, as it did in Aleppo in January and February, is there a crackdown. But such systematized thievery has become entrenched in an economy that is more corrupt than ever. Regime-allied armed groups often set up checkpoints and extort taxes from farmers and businessmen, making it that much harder to earn a living. ''You pay through the nose to transport anything anywhere,'' I was told by a man who manufactures plastics and has seen most of his profit margin disappear. ''Bashar can't do anything about this. He is in survival mode.'' Meanwhile, war profiteers (tujjar al-harb -- another phrase you hear a lot in Syria nowadays) have become well-known figures. I was amazed to see new, lavish-looking restaurants in Damascus; some of them belong to men who are said to have grown rich from crime. Members of the old Damascus business elite wince when they describe the clientele in these places. One friend told me, ''You see a guy in a business suit in a fancy bar talking to a thuggish-looking guy in fatigues, and you understand the conversation without hearing anything.'' Some of these men are also widely said to sell oil to rebel groups for huge profits.

Late last year, Iran abruptly suspended oil deliveries, which have become a lifeline for Syria. Iran acted because it was angry about the amount of its fuel that was being diverted and sold to rebels by regime-connected middlemen, I was told by a Syrian who has close ties to Hezbollah, Iran's ally. The suspension created a serious fuel crisis in winter. Iran resumed its supplies in mid-February, but Tehran has little choice: It needs Assad as much as he needs it. There are reports of similar tensions with the Russians, who are more interested in brokering an end to the fighting than Assad is. The Syrian businessman put it like this: ''Bashar is like a man with two false legs -- one is Russia and one is Iran. He keeps hopping from one leg to the other, because the ground he is standing on is very hot.''

All this may sound awfully precarious for Assad. But in a sense, it is just a more extreme form of the game Assad and his father have played for decades. The Assad regime arose after an unstable period during the 1950s and '60s, when Syria was shaken by coups and countercoups. Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, triumphed in part by managing a constellation of rivals who hated one another but were all dependent on him. They knew that without him at the center, chaos would return, and that would be bad for business. This is truer than ever today. And it has a secondary effect, not unimportant: Many ordinary people now see Assad as their only hedge against a far more toxic kind of chaos.

My Syrian businessman friend told me that he twice gathered about a dozen people for dinner and offered them a hypothetical in strict confidence. It is up to you to name the next president of Syria, he said. Whom would you choose? The guests were all Syrians, and none supported the regime. To his surprise, almost all of them named Assad. When he asked why, the same answer came back again and again: Assad is the only one who can protect us against his own devils.

While I was in Syria, I found myself thinking now and again about the vast street demonstrations I saw in Iran in 2009. This was just after the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, when millions of people marched peacefully through the streets of Tehran. The crowd drew from every social class, every generation. A peaceful popular movement seemed to have brought the theocratic regime to its knees. Soon after the largest march, on June 15, the police and the Basij militia came out in force, spraying tear gas and beating people with truncheons. Protests went on for months, but eventually they dwindled to a hard core, and the regime crushed the movement with relative ease. I often wondered about all those people I saw in the streets on June 15. At the time, their absence felt a bit like cowardice to me. Now it feels more like a kind of earned political wisdom. They stayed home not because they preferred the regime but because they did not want to risk death. And perhaps because they did not want to see their country torn apart.

Anas Joudeh, the Damascus lawyer, told me that the absence of this kind of wisdom is precisely what doomed Syria. For years, he said, he and his friends cast around looking for someone to blame for the failure of the 2011 revolution. ''We often asked, If only this, or if only that,'' he said. ''But now I feel that what happened was destiny. Because there are no political or social forces in Syria. The regime emptied them out. So when the regime looked to make a deal in 2011, there was no one there.'' I took Joudeh to be saying that the regime might have been willing to share power, in some limited way, if the opposition had been more organized, more conciliatory. Perhaps it is naïe to suggest that the regime could have offered genuine reforms of its own accord. Police states are not known for voluntarily giving up power in the interest of building a better future. Assad has spoken the language of reform ever since he inherited his role from his father in 2000, and he has never followed through on any of it. Still, there is one story that has haunted me.

On March 30, 2011, Assad delivered a televised speech to Syria's rubber-stamp Parliament that is widely viewed in retrospect as a crucial step in the country's descent into war. He had kept silent during the previous two weeks of protest and violence. Some of his advisers and proxies had hinted, in the days beforehand, that he would make historic proposals, offering a hand to the protesters and paving the way for genuine national reconciliation. Much of the region tuned in as Assad walked up a red carpet into the Parliament building past a cheering crowd. But his speech quickly turned into a familiar, embarrassing spectacle, with lawmakers chanting his name and interrupting his speech with fawning accolades. Assad delivered a hard-line speech deriding the protesters as dupes of a foreign-backed plot to destroy the country. He closed on an ominous note, saying: ''There is no compromise or middle way in this. What is at stake is the homeland, and there is a huge conspiracy. ... We have never hesitated in defending our causes, interests and principles, and if we are forced into a battle, so be it.''

One former regime official told me that he recalls watching the speech with a sense of shock and dismay. He and other high-ranking officials had heard in advance the details of what the speech was supposed to say. It had been drafted, they were told, by Vice President Farouk al-Shara, and it emphasized reconciliation with the protesters. Shara had received input from several other top officials with similar inclinations. This version of the speech even had the support of Hezbollah's leaders, who believed that genuine gestures of compromise could head off a war, the former official said. Other people close to the regime have echoed this account, though there are analysts who are skeptical; it's almost impossible to be sure about what happens in Assad's secretive inner circle.

What is certain is that Assad did not deliver the speech that was expected. Instead, the former official said, he scrapped it at the last minute in favor of a much more aggressive text. ''When I heard the speech, my feeling was -- we are in for a long fight,'' the former official told me. ''I was in my office. We looked around at each other and did not say a word.'' He remains convinced that if Assad had given the other speech, the past six years would have unrolled very differently, and oceans of blood might have been spared.

Few people in Syria have any patience for this kind of wistful talk. Former regime critics like Joudeh now confine themselves to pressing for the smallest-bore reforms: better training for the police and judiciary, more local control in towns and cities, a diminished role for the Baath Party and its outmoded Arab Nationalist bromides. But even this will not happen while the war continues, and it may be even less likely afterward. Assad has a genius for corrupting everyone around him, in ways large and small (some of his advisers are said to be receiving land in bombed-out rebel areas). Even giving in to these mild measures of hope can start to make you feel dirty, as if you had been played for a fool. The alternative, of course, is an ecumenical cynicism toward everyone and everything. This is the default mentality for most Syrians I know.

In my time in Syria, I met one person who seemed to evade both of these traps. I hesitate to use the word ''hero,'' because he would violently reject it. But he held onto a dogged civic idealism that was divorced from hope of any kind. In a sense, he was the inverse of Abu Sami, the professor who shut himself off from the war inside his home. He was a 57-year-old engineer named Tarif Attora, who appeared to be working himself to death running a group called the Aleppo People's Initiative. He and his teams repair water pipes and electricity lines and supply food and medical aid to people in need. They do this in both regime and rebel areas, unlike the White Helmets, the rescue group that was lionized in an Academy Award-winning documentary. He is the only person I know who has the unreserved admiration of both rebel leaders and die-hard regime loyalists.

I met Attora in the initiative's office, where he sat at a battered desk with a vast map of the city -- east and west -- on the wall behind him. The desk was covered with stacked files and old coffee mugs, and he interrupted our talk several times to bark instructions to site managers. (''Don't strain the lines. You're getting 50. It should be 25 to 30.'') He has steel-gray hair that is cut short and flat on the top of his head, and his face -- stark, creased with vertical lines, square-jawed -- looks a bit like Albert Camus's might have if he lived a decade longer.

The initiative started in July 2012, when Attora gathered roughly 30 engineers and other professionals -- all Aleppo residents -- to talk about how they could help protect the city. Some were with the opposition, some were not, and there were arguments. They agreed on one thing: the need to keep the lights on and the water running. So they asked the authorities for permission and began reaching out to all the rebel groups. Soon they had hundreds of volunteers working with them and repair crews going everywhere, even the front lines. The state water company supplied pipes and materials, but apart from that, the initiative is entirely self-funding, Attora said. Six of its members have been killed. Many others have been wounded, including Attora.

He told me several harrowing stories about his work in what he called ''hot zones.'' Twice he came close to being killed, and his back is now broken in two places. Jihadi groups were in control of Aleppo's main power plant for more than a year, so he ended up dealing with them a lot. Once, he saw something that left him traumatized for months. He asked me not to report the details, because it might anger the people involved and limit his ability to work with them. Despite the trauma -- which still haunts him -- he did not want to jeopardize his ability ''to continue working in all areas,'' he said.

I asked Attora why he does it, and he hesitated. He seemed uncomfortable dealing with abstractions. ''Freedom doesn't come from destroying the country,'' he said as he put out what must have been his 10th cigarette since our conversation started and lit another. ''Look, people consider me opposition,'' he said. ''But the way I see opposition -- it doesn't mean I must destroy my country and put us back 100 years. That kind of opposition is a betrayal of the country, a betrayal of the ideals I've grown up with.''

He seemed unsatisfied with his words, and he glanced around the room, as if he were looking for an excuse to stop talking and get back to his engineers. It was getting dark outside. ''We all served the politics of other countries in our own land, whether we knew it or not,'' he said. ''Everybody has to wake up. To be brave, to admit they've made mistakes, to come back to the right way.''

I stood up to shake Attora's hand and say goodbye. His face cracked into a smile, and the phone rang. He picked it up, and instantly he was at home again, supervising repairs on a power line that would probably be blown up again tomorrow.

RE: OPEN MARRIAGE

Susan Dominus wrote about the experiences of nonmonogamous couples.

I cannot express the depth of feelings this article brought up on many levels. I was touched within the first three sentences. This is a topic that does not routinely enjoy open dialogue as people tend to prefer obscurity around these issues. But ongoing murkiness only perpetuates unhappiness and dissatisfaction, not to mention resentment. I personally have been involved in an extramarital relationship for three years.

Yet through Dominus's thorough treatment and the candid experiences of those profiled, along with her completely nonjudgmental posture, I came to terms with my own need to be clear about how I want to participate in all relationships going forward, whether romantic or professional, unconventional or ''normal.'' As a writer, I found that the article also gave me the gift of bravery to write honestly, as it will touch someone, somewhere. Thank you for an amazingly researched and written story. Leslie, Irvine, Calif.

Dominus's article was informative, but it had one big flaw: the choice to feature Daniel and Elizabeth. Daniel and Elizabeth, we learn, have an open marriage. Elizabeth, the author informs us, is having an affair with a married man. That man's wife does not know about Elizabeth or the relationship. In choosing Daniel and Elizabeth, Dominus fuels the very stereotype that she attempts to poke a hole in: that polyamorous couples cause the ''degradation of marriage.''

There are plenty of polyamorous couples on equal footing, couples who have mutual long-term relationships with either open married people or single people. The whole point of an open marriage is transparency, full disclosure and the avoidance of uncomfortable secrets. Madeline Schwartzman, Brooklyn

RE: HOMEOWNERSHIP

Matthew Desmond wrote about the role of the mortgage-interest deduction, or MID -- and how it benefits the wealthy and upper middle class -- in American homeownership.

I am in complete agreement with Desmond about the regressive nature of the mortgage-interest deduction. In the recent book I co-edited, ''Ending Homelessness: Why We Haven't, How We Can,'' several authors and I echo the truly outrageous nature of the MID.

However, Desmond doesn't go far enough in pointing out inequities in the system. Over the last 40 years, inflation-adjusted incomes of the top 1 percent of wage earners in this country have risen by 241 percent, while incomes of the bottom 90 percent have stagnated, barely keeping up with the cost of living. The top 20 percent of households control more than 80 percent of all the wealth in the country. This is true inequality. If Desmond is really interested in braving the proverbial third rail of American economic policy, why not means-test the MID, Medicare and Social Security and fundamentally change the tax system in this country. Perhaps we should even consider a universal basic income for everyone, means-tested, of course. Donald W. Burnes, Ph.D., founder and board chairman, The Burnes Center on Poverty and Homelessness, University of Denver

I have been a lawyer specializing in mortgage law since 1978. The article is correct in saying that the MID is unfair and inflates home prices. I personally own my home outright with no mortgage, so I do not benefit directly from the MID, though I do benefit from the author's little discussed property-tax deduction, which, though smaller than the MID for most people, is significant and also distorts housing prices. Real estate taxes in the Northeast are exorbitant, often tens of thousands of dollars a year, all deductible. The MID and the real estate tax deduction work together to benefit homeowners, but the author barely mentions this fact.

I would be happy to lose my real estate tax deduction if it meant that more people were able to own homes, but the increase in federal tax revenue resulting from the elimination of both deductions would more likely pay off things like the ''mother of all bombs'' dropped on ISIS or the hideously expensive missiles rained down on an airfield in Syria.

Why not level the playing field and allow renters to deduct their rent? That way we would ensure that the benefit flowed directly to renters. This could be paid for by a sliding-scale cap on both the MID and the real estate tax deduction. Instead of arbitrary caps, the percentage of deductibility would decrease as the homeowner's income increases. Nancy Hopkins, Lucketts, Va.

How Not To Fight Trump

IT is understandable that many people in American government are unhappy that Donald Trump is the president of the United States. It is also understandable that many people would contemplate constitutional mechanisms that might remove him from that office.

But so long as Trump remains the president -- and even those of us who imagine 25th Amendment remedies would be wise to bet on at least three years and seven months more -- then ad hoc, partisan and extra-constitutional attempts to strip him of normal presidential powers are a very bad idea.

This is basically what we have in the Fourth Circuit Court's ruling striking down the administration's controversial travel ban, which seeks to temporarily restrict travel to the United States from six majority-Muslim countries -- Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Somalia -- that are either ruled by terror-sponsoring governments or in the throes of civil war.

There are reasons to think this ban overbroad, counterproductive, damaging to U.S. interests. But it not a ''Muslim ban'' under any reasonable legal definition of the term, and on its face it looks entirely constitutional. As the Fourth Circuit concedes, the president has broad powers to restrict the entry of noncitizens, and an executive order restricting travel from a specified set of terror-affected countries would normally easily pass muster.

But what is different in this case, the Fourth Circuit judges argue, is that Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric about Islam, his wild promise to keep all Muslims out ''until we know what's going on,'' proves that this executive order is really motivated by a religious animus that conflicts with the First Amendment's religious-freedom guarantee.

Of course, constitutional guarantees do not normally apply to foreign nationals. But allowing an immigration restriction motivated by religious animus, the opinion argues, would create a strong likelihood that some ''constitutional harm will redound to citizens'' as well. And this is enough, it concludes, to make an order that only directly affects foreigners a violation of every American Muslim's First Amendment rights.

The second half of the argument is a remarkable constitutional bankshot. But it's the first half that's most troubling, because it effectively creates what David French of National Review -- no Trump admirer -- describes as a kind of ''Trumplaw,'' a set of restrictions on presidential action that only apply to Donald Trump. This president cannot do things that would be perfectly legal if any other president did them, under this standard, because the courts will rule against his past demagogy rather than the policies themselves.

To some members of the Resistance this may sound like a brilliant approach. It is not. First, as the dissenting opinion rightly notes, it establishes a precedent that would further politicize an already-partisan judiciary, by licensing judges to constantly look beyond the law for excuses to rule against politicians (liberal or conservative) they dislike.

Second, it effectively tells populist politicians who flout norms on the campaign trail that they needn't bother moderating once in office, because the system has already decided that they can't. So it doesn't matter that Trump has shifted his tone on Islam; it doesn't matter that he spent the days before the ruling palling around with Saudis like a Bush Republican. Once a deplorable, always a deplorable -- a judgment that's likely to only confirm future populists in their antinomian and extralegal impulses.

And not only future populists but this White House, which remains responsible for counterterrorism in an age when the most important terror threats are Islamist, and any move to safeguard Americans is likely to have a disproportionate effect on Muslims.

One of the things that Trump critics fear most is his possible response to a Manchester-type terrorist attack (or something even worse). But rather than providing a check on future anti-terror overreach, the Fourth Circuit's overreaching opinion is likely to encourage it.

After all, if you tell the White House that it cannot do things that normal presidents are allowed to do because of Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric, what incentive does the White House have to work carefully within constitutional lines should ISIS or Al Qaeda strike?

Instead, if the courts are automatically going to rule against Trump on any counterterrorism issue that touches on Islam, the president may feel that he may as well prepare for war with the judiciary, since tailoring his policies to fit existing precedents is clearly just a waste.

There was a lot of loose talk about a ''constitutional crisis'' in the wake of the firing of James Comey. But it's easier to imagine the term applying, as it did in the days of Trump's idol Andrew Jackson, to a direct clash between the White House and the courts.

Trump's flaws of temperament and character make such a clash dangerously likely. But so does a judicial activism that cuts down normal legal precedent in order to go after him, and tries to pre-emptively strip away his powers without any warrant save self-righteousness.

'Forgive Me': The Tangled Path To the Bombing in Manchester

MANCHESTER, England -- Salman Abedi was wearing a red vest, his suicide bomb hidden in a small backpack, when he phoned his younger brother in Libya and asked him to put his mother on the line. It was about 10:20 p.m. on Monday, and the call was short.

''How are you doing, Mom? Please forgive me for anything I did wrong,'' he said, and hung up.

A short time later, he walked through the glass doors of the Manchester Arena, the city's biggest concert venue, lingered for a few minutes by the stalls selling merchandise related to Ariana Grande, the American singer who was performing there that night, and blew himself up, killing 22 people and wounding 116 more.

Since the attack, the police have taken 11 people into custody, and on Saturday Britain lowered its threat level from ''critical'' to ''severe.'' Officials are confident that they have captured the entire network. But the investigation continues into the network's hierarchy, the precise logistics involved in planning the bombing, and what motivated Mr. Abedi.

The brief phone call to his mother -- ''forgive me for anything I did wrong'' -- encapsulated a deeply complicated family tale of conflict and rebellion, a complex interweaving of personal histories and the tortured recent history of Libya.

It is the story of a strict father's flight from the repression of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's leader at the time, and a personal jihad against that dictatorship, which in turn shook up his children's world.

The seismic tremors from Libya's revolution in 2011 reverberated across geographical and generational borders, in Manchester's sizable Libyan population -- the largest outside Libya -- and in the Abedi family as well. Almost certainly, the events that helped set Salman Abedi on his hauntingly familiar path, from quiet boy in a strict Islamic household to troubled young man to, eventually, suicide bomber, began there.

As Colonel Qaddafi tottered in 2011, Mr. Abedi's father, Ramadan, returned to Libya to finish the fight he had started two decades earlier, and took his British-born teenage sons with him. The elder Mr. Abedi, a onetime Qaddafi enforcer, fled Libya in 1991 after supporting Islamists seeking to overthrow the brutal leader. Now, as Western warplanes pummeled Tripoli, the capital, that dream was finally coming true.

His sons -- Ismail, Salman and Hashem -- accompanied Mr. Abedi to Tunisia, where he worked on logistics for the rebels in western Libya. The sons knew very little about Libya, having grown up in the Whalley Range, a working-class area of Manchester. But their father, a proud Islamist, wanted them to follow in his footsteps at this euphoric moment.

Salman, a lanky 16-year-old at the time, joined his father as the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade descended on the Libyan capital that summer. A year later, Ramadan snapped a photograph of the 15-year-old Hashem holding a machine gun.

''Hashem the lion... training,'' read the caption on the father's Facebook page.

They were not the only ones to make the journey from Britain. Akram Ramadan, who fought alongside Ramadan Abedi, recalled there being a strong contingent known as ''the Manchester fighters.''

''We were all fighting,'' Mr. Ramadan said in Manchester. ''Drug dealers from here were fighting -- everybody went.''

After gaining a taste of battle, Salman was sent back to Manchester, while his father decided to stay.

There is no way to prove that this experience in Libya put Salman on the path that led him to the doors of the Manchester Arena. But the experience of armed struggle in one generation can beget violence in the next, terrorism experts say, even with an entirely different ideological underpinning.

''The older generation normalizes militancy,'' said Raffaello Pantucci, a specialist in researching terrorism at the Royal United Services Institute. ''Which direction it goes depends on the time. And the kids rebel against their parents.''

And rebel Salman certainly did. According to accounts by family friends and neighbors, his strict Muslim upbringing was upended by the events of 2011.

He had been a quiet boy who was teased, and sometimes bullied, at school, a former classmate recalled. A fan of Manchester United, he developed a passion and aptitude for soccer.

''He was polite, just a normal teenager,'' said one neighbor, who remembers him as a boy.

'They Can Get Lost'

But that changed with the fall of Colonel Qaddafi. While Salman's father stayed in Libya, he lived with his mother and siblings in Manchester, where he began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana. Some said he fell in with local gangs. He became known for a temper and a readiness to fight.

Mr. Ramadan said the absence of a father figure was often a problem for Libyan families, particularly the Abedi sons, whose father imposed strict discipline.

''There was a lot of it here, putting pressure on their kids to become very, very, over the top, good Muslim kids,'' Mr. Ramadan said.

''When the revolution kicked off and all these dads went to Libya to fight, the kids found freedom,'' Mr. Ramadan said, adding that Salman's mother, Samia, was unable to control him.

Salah Rashid, 69, the mother's accountant, concurred. ''I've seen many residents leave for Libya,'' he said. ''If they don't embrace their children and teenagers, they can get lost.''

In Libya in the days immediately after the bombing, the father was arrested by a militia, the Special Deterrence Forces, which said it had also detained Salman's younger brother, Hashem, now 20. It was a spokesman for the militia who provided the details about Salman's phone call to his family before the bombing.

His father divided his time between Manchester, where he led prayers at a local mosque, and Tripoli, where he worked as an administrator in the Interior Ministry. As other Arab countries plunged into conflict, he cheered on like-minded Islamists like the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in Syria.

In Manchester, the Abedi family were well known at Didsbury Mosque, a longstanding establishment popular with Manchester's large Libyan population and the diaspora from other Arab countries. Ramadan Abedi, who had studied the Quran in Saudi Arabia, often did the call to prayer.

Known by the honorific Abu Ismael, he had a ''particularly beautiful voice,'' congregants recalled. Salman's older brother, Ismail, helped out at the mosque with I.T. support and some teaching. He was arrested in Britain in the days after the bombing.

Salman was a more solitary figure. ''He barely even attended Eid prayers,'' said Mohammed Fadil, 25, who knows Salman's older brother. ''He kept away from the community. When prayer finishes, you stay behind, you chat. With him it was different.''

When he did come, it was usually with his father, Mr. Fadil said, ''but after his father had moved back to Libya, there was no reason for him to come anymore.'' And with his father gone, Salman was showing signs of following a different path.

The last time Salman was noticed at the mosque was during a Friday prayer session in 2015 when the imam gave a sermon that was critical of the Islamic State. Salman angrily objected. It was around this time that at least two members of the congregation reported him on a counterterrorism hotline for expressing extremist views.

But as older Libyans spent their time discussing politics in their homeland, some younger ones, like Mr. Abedi, found an ideology elsewhere -- one that by now had supporters in both Britain and Libya.

Salman Abedi and other family members visited their father in Libya regularly. By 2015, the Islamic State had established a base in the city of Surt, and had hidden pockets of support in cities like Tripoli, where the Abedi family is from.

It was there, according to officials from Libya and the United States, that Salman established a connection with Abdul Baset Ghwela, a radical preacher whose son had died fighting in the eastern city of Benghazi.

Back in Manchester, he is believed to have had links with other young residents of the city who joined the Islamic State in recent years, security officials said. One of them is Raphael Hostey, a prolific recruiter for ISIS who is believed to have been killed in a drone strike in Syria in May last year, aged 24.

Despite denials from Mr. Hostey's brother, Junade, officials believe that Mr. Abedi and Mr. Hostey knew each other before Mr. Hostey left for Syria in 2013. ''He was his hero,'' one law enforcement official said of Mr. Abedi's admiration for Mr. Hostey.

The killing of Mr. Hostey was the start of a fateful two weeks that may have further steeled Mr. Abedi's urge for revenge.

A week later, another acquaintance, Abdalraouf Abdallah, 24, was jailed for nine years after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism. The very next day, Abdul Wahab Hafidah -- a friend of Salman and a close friend of his younger brother -- was run over and then stabbed to death in Manchester, in what the police called a gang-related episode.

The killing was a ''wake-up call'' for Libyan parents about their children's involvement with gangs, said Ahmed Sewehli, a psychiatrist. ''It was a big deal in the Libyan community.''

'He Was Always Alone'

Around this time, Salman is believed to have started planning Monday's attack. He opened a bank account, which would go unused until he used it to buy supplies for his suicide bomb from two hardware stores nearly a year later. The money in the account came from student loans, officials confirmed on Saturday -- loans that he continued to receive even after dropping out of Salford University, where he enrolled in 2015 to study business management.

He made little mark at the university. One fellow student said he had come to just a handful of lectures before disappearing.

''I saw him in the prayer room sometimes,'' said Abdul Omar, 22, a second-year student who presides over the university's Islamic Society. ''I remember seeing him waiting a bit earlier for the prayer. He was always alone.''

In recent months Mr. Abedi had been worshiping at the Salaam Community and Masjid in the Moss Side area of Manchester. But here, too, things did not go smoothly.

Though typically quiet and withdrawn, he was reprimanded twice, once for lingering after dawn prayers when he was supposed to have left the building. When admonished by Abdullah Muhsin Norris, the chairman of the board of trustees at the mosque, he reacted badly, saying he didn't want to be shouted at, only to be told in response that he was ''acting like a child.''

On a separate occasion, Mr. Abedi objected when a beardless Libyan member of the congregation was about to lead prayers. ''He walked out,'' said Mr. Norris, who added that he had not seen Mr. Abedi since he reprimanded him and that, had it not been for those two incidents, he would not have noticed him.

Tensions were growing within the Abedi family. Alarmed at the direction his son was taking, Salman's father forced him to come to Libya this spring and briefly confiscated his passport.

When Mr. Ramadan, the family friend, last met Mr. Abedi less than three months ago, he initially failed to recognize the young man, who was leaning on a car outside his brother's home, waiting to pick him up for prayers in a long, beige-colored, Islamic shirt.

But Mr. Abedi recognized his father's friend and greeted him with the Arabic term for ''uncle.''

''I hope you are not doing any naughty tricks or pranks anymore,'' said Mr. Ramadan, referring to Mr. Abedi's past reputation.

''No, no, no,'' Mr. Abedi had answered. ''I quit doing pranks.''

IT is understandable that many people in American government are unhappy that Donald Trump is the president of the United States. It is also understandable that many people would contemplate constitutional mechanisms that might remove him from that office.

But so long as Trump remains the president —nd even those of us who imagine 25th Amendment remedies would be wise to bet on at least three years and seven months more —hen ad hoc, partisan and extra-constitutional attempts to strip him of normal presidential powers are a very bad idea.

This is basically what we have in the Fourth Circuit Court’ ruling striking down the administration’ controversial travel ban, which seeks to temporarily restrict travel to the United States from six majority-Muslim countries —udan, Iran, Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Somalia —hat are either ruled by terror-sponsoring governments or in the throes of civil war.

There are reasons to think this ban overbroad, counterproductive, damaging to U.S. interests. But it not a “uslim ban”nder any reasonable legal definition of the term, and on its face it looks entirely constitutional. As the Fourth Circuit concedes, the president has broad powers to restrict the entry of noncitizens, and an executive order restricting travel from a specified set of terror-affected countries would normally easily pass muster.

But what is different in this case, the Fourth Circuit judges argue, is that Trump’ campaign-trail rhetoric about Islam, his wild promise to keep all Muslims out “ntil we know what’ going on,”roves that this executive order is really motivated by a religious animus that conflicts with the First Amendment’ religious-freedom guarantee.

Of course, constitutional guarantees do not normally apply to foreign nationals. But allowing an immigration restriction motivated by religious animus, the opinion argues, would create a strong likelihood that some “onstitutional harm will redound to citizens”s well. And this is enough, it concludes, to make an order that only directly affects foreigners a violation of every American Muslim’ First Amendment rights.

The second half of the argument is a remarkable constitutional bankshot. But it’ the first half that’ most troubling, because it effectively creates what David French of National Review —o Trump admirer —escribes as a kind of “Trumplaw,” set of restrictions on presidential action that only apply to Donald Trump. This president cannot do things that would be perfectly legal if any other president did them, under this standard, because the courts will rule against his past demagogy rather than the policies themselves.

To some members of the Resistance this may sound like a brilliant approach. It is not. First, as the dissenting opinion rightly notes, it establishes a precedent that would further politicize an already-partisan judiciary, by licensing judges to constantly look beyond the law for excuses to rule against politicians (liberal or conservative) they dislike.

Second, it effectively tells populist politicians who flout norms on the campaign trail that they needn’ bother moderating once in office, because the system has already decided that they can’. So it doesn’ matter that Trump has shifted his tone on Islam; it doesn’ matter that he spent the days before the ruling palling around with Saudis like a Bush Republican. Once a deplorable, always a deplorable — judgment that’ likely to only confirm future populists in their antinomian and extralegal impulses.

And not only future populists but this White House, which remains responsible for counterterrorism in an age when the most important terror threats are Islamist, and any move to safeguard Americans is likely to have a disproportionate effect on Muslims.

One of the things that Trump critics fear most is his possible response to a Manchester-type terrorist attack (or something even worse). But rather than providing a check on future anti-terror overreach, the Fourth Circuit’ overreaching opinion is likely to encourage it.

After all, if you tell the White House that it cannot do things that normal presidents are allowed to do because of Trump’ campaign-trail rhetoric, what incentive does the White House have to work carefully within constitutional lines should ISIS or Al Qaeda strike?

Instead, if the courts are automatically going to rule against Trump on any counterterrorism issue that touches on Islam, the president may feel that he may as well prepare for war with the judiciary, since tailoring his policies to fit existing precedents is clearly just a waste.

There was a lot of loose talk about a “onstitutional crisis”n the wake of the firing of James Comey. But it’ easier to imagine the term applying, as it did in the days of Trump’ idol Andrew Jackson, to a direct clash between the White House and the courts.

Trump’ flaws of temperament and character make such a clash dangerously likely. But so does a judicial activism that cuts down normal legal precedent in order to go after him, and tries to pre-emptively strip away his powers without any warrant save self-righteousness.

Journalist's Footage Shows Iraqi Forces Torturing Civilians, ABC Report Says

Video smuggled out of Iraq by an Iraqi journalist and broadcast by ABC News on Thursday appears to show members of an Iraqi special forces unit -- one that has been praised by the United States -- torturing and executing civilians in Mosul during a campaign against the Islamic State last year.

On Friday, a spokesman for the U.S. military coalition in Iraq and Syria said that it was aware of the journalist's claims and had raised them with the Iraqi government.

''We take all allegations of human rights abuses very seriously and we immediately, as we did with this particular case, flag that and present it and give it to the government of Iraq for their action,'' the spokesman, Col. Ryan S. Dillon, said at a news conference in London on Friday.

The disturbing footage appears to show uniformed Iraqi soldiers beating Iraqi civilians and hanging one man from the ceiling by his wrists while demanding they confess to working with the Islamic State. Iraqi officials have called for an investigation into the violence.

The journalist who took the video, Ali Arkady, was embedded with the unit for several months last year as it battled the Islamic State. ABC News said on Thursday that Mr. Arkady had received death threats from the soldiers implicated in the footage and had fled Iraq to seek asylum in Europe.

Mr. Arkady told ABC he originally had intended to do a story on how Sunni and Shiite soldiers worked together in the unit, the Emergency Response Division of Iraq's Ministry of Interior, to fight ISIS. He previously embedded with the unit when it helped push the Islamic State out of Falluja and made a video at that time, ''Happy Baghdad,'' that portrayed the division positively.

Mr. Arkady told ABC News that the unit's commanding officers believed he would make another favorable video. But after the commanders grew to trust him, they invited him to take footage as they tortured civilians and coerced them into confessing to working with the Islamic State, confessions that Mr. Arkady believed to be false.

He also told ABC that he twice obeyed commands from the division's leaders to strike detainees, because he felt he had no choice.

Capt. Omar Nazar, one of the commanders of the special forces unit, declined to dispute the authenticity of the tapes in a phone interview with ABC News last week. He said the brutal tactics caught on video were justified because the victims had connections to the Islamic State.

''We do not want war prisoners in our fight against ISIS,'' he told ABC News. ''We don't take prisoners.''

The United States has praised the Emergency Response Division as recently as last January. In a briefing with reporters at that time, United States Army Col. Brett Sylvia, the commander of Task Force Strike in Baghdad, said the unit was ''a very effective fighting force'' and had recently been advised by American officers.

''This is the first time that we have advised them,'' Colonel Sylvia said at the time, according to ABC News. ''And it has been really a fruitful partnership in all regards.''

But accusations of sectarian abuses have long plagued Iraqi forces and have caused concern as the battle for Mosul, a predominantly Sunni city, has dragged on.

No American military advisers appear on the video. But ABC News said that one of the men shown torturing two civilians -- who Mr. Arkady said were half brothers -- claimed to be a United States military interpreter and contractor.

ABC News said the American embassy and American commanders in Baghdad declined requests to appear on camera, but told the network they had no knowledge of the abuses captured on tape.

''The U.S. has not provided military aid, arms or assistance to the Emergency Response Division,'' Kim Dubois, a United States embassy spokeswoman in Baghdad, told ABC News in a statement.

Colonel Dillon said on Friday that U.S. forces were not involved with the Iraqi unit with which Mr. Arkady had worked.

''We did not have U.S. advisers with this particular unit at this time,'' he said.

Philippines Strains to Clear  ISIS -Inspired Militants From Southern City

MANILA -- As fighting continued Friday between government forces and Islamic State-linked insurgents in the southern Philippines, the government said that foreign militants were among those taking part in the clashes.

Jose Calida, the government's solicitor general, said Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans were fighting alongside local Abu Sayyaf and Maute group members in Marawi, a Muslim-majority city of about 200,000 people. The city, on the island of Mindanao, has been largely deserted since residents fled clashes this week.

''What's happening in Mindanao is no longer a rebellion of Filipino citizens,'' Mr. Calida said.

The intense fighting led President Rodrigo Duterte to declare martial law in the southern Philippines this week, and he warned that he could impose it on the whole country if the Islamist threat spread.

While Abu Sayyaf, the main group fighting the government, has pledged its allegiance to the Islamic State, it predates that group, and it has been behind a series of attacks across Mindanao in recent years.

The fighting broke out when government forces moved to capture the leader of an Abu Sayyaf faction, Isnilon Hapilon, after he had been spotted in Marawi this week. But government forces were surprised by the heavy resistance they encountered.

The rebels went on a rampage, burning several buildings and taking hostage a Roman Catholic priest and several parishioners. There was no word on their fate Friday, three days after they were kidnapped.

The fighting has resulted in the deaths of 31 militants, 11 soldiers and two police officers as of Thursday night. The government said at least six of the slain fighters were believed to be foreigners.

Reports of foreign militants fighting in Mindanao, however, are not new. Foreign jihadists were spotted in rebel camps in the south as long as two decades ago. Muslim rebel fighters, too, have been known to cross over to nearby Malaysia and Indonesia to train there.

Aid agencies began arriving in Marawi on Friday in an attempt to help people left behind in the city.

A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said they were assisting the local government and troops in evacuating residents and providing them with essentials like water.

But the British aid agency Oxfam said ''very little is known of the plight of civilians'' who chose to wait it out in Marawi, where sporadic clashes were continuing.

''Aside from sketchy reporting about men, women and children exposed to a higher risk of being killed and injured, there is no actual account of those individuals and families affected and information as to where they will go to for safe evacuation,'' it said.

Gunmen in Egypt Force Christian Pilgrims From Buses and Kill 28

CAIRO —ressed in military fatigues, the gunmen waved down the bus filled with Christian pilgrims as it wended its way down a dusty side-road in the desert of western Egypt , headed toward a monastery.

Claiming to be security officers, the gunmen ordered the passengers to get out. They separated the men from the women and children, and ordered them to surrender their mobile phones. They instructed the men to recite the shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith.

When the men refused, the gunmen started to shoot.

At least 28 people were killed, several with a single shot to the head, according to the Egyptian authorities and relatives of the victims. The attack on Friday in Minya Province, 120 miles south of Cairo, was a coldblooded escalation of sectarian violence targeting minority Christians  that has left more than 100 people dead since December  and shaken the country’ government.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility in the latest assault, and, according to the Egyptian Health Ministry , many of the victims were children. Yet the attack bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State, which in the past six months has dispatched suicide bombers into crowded Sunday services in three Egyptian cities, and caused an entire community in northern Sinai to flee their homes  in panic.

The Egyptian response came hours later. As President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi delivered a speech from the presidential palace warning that the attack on Christians “ill not go unanswered,”he military announced that Egyptian fighter jets had carried out airstrikes on several militant camps inside Libya. In eastern Libya, a military force led by Gen. Khalifa Hifter , a close ally of Egypt , said it had taken part in the air raids, Reuters reported.

State media said that some attacks hit Derna, a town in eastern Libya that is home to several Islamist militias. It was not the first such reprisal. Egypt also carried out airstrikes inside Libya in 2015 after militants beheaded 21 Coptic Christian migrants.

Still, the attacks on Libya hinted that the gunmen responsible for the latest violence could have come through Egypt’ western desert — potentially new flank in a war that has until now centered on Sinai in the east of the country.

In staging the Minya attack, at least seven armed assailants, some masked, lay in wait for the victims on a sandy road leading from a busy highway to the Monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor, which is home to about 100 monks. They attacked three vehicles traveling in convoy —wo buses carrying worshipers from the nearby province of Beni Suef, and a pickup truck carrying laborers, all headed to the monastery.

Among the first to die were the drivers, like Atef Mounir, a 62-year-old construction worker who was killed by a single gunshot to the head. His nephew Daniel Gamal recounted Mr. Mounir’ death based on the testimony from survivors of the attack.

“hey said the terrorists made a group get out of their vehicles and took their phones,”e said, speaking from the hospital where he had come to identify his uncle’ body. “hen they shot everyone.”

Peter Edwar, a Christian activist who was among the first on the scene, said some men had been forced to say the shahada. Some witnesses reported the militants filmed the entire attack. Not everyone was forced out of their vehicles, which appeared to explain how dozens had survived.

“y the time they killed half of the people, the terrorists saw cars coming in the distance and we think that that is what saved the rest,”aid Magdy Malek, a lawmaker in Minya who visited victims of the attack on Friday. “hey did not have time to kill them all. They just shot at them randomly and then fled.”

The wounded were rushed to hospitals in Minya where doctors scrambled to save their lives. The medical staffs also had to contend with the anger and grief of hundreds of people searching for news about their relatives.

“veryone is trying to identify the dead and wounded,”aid Bishop Makarios, the leader of the Copts in Minya. “here is no time for anger yet.”

The bishop has become an outspoken critic  of Egyptian security lapses  after previous violence against Christians in Minya. Most Egyptian Copts see Mr. Sisi as their protector against Islamist violence, and are reluctant to criticize him in public.

Communal tensions are highest in Minya, where about one-third of the population is Christian, and which has seen regular spasms of mob violence in recent years. The attacks on Christians are often triggered by tensions over the building of churches and underpinned by deep-rooted prejudices on the part of Muslim officials and the police.

But Friday’ attack suggested something new: that Christians in Minya are now vulnerable to attack by organized militant groups using the vast western desert as a staging ground.

In its determination to kill Christians, whom it gleefully terms as its “avorite prey,”he Islamic State has underscored its intent to wage a war of sectarian bloodshed in Egypt akin to the one it inflicted on Syria and Iraq.

Experts say the group is highly unlikely to get that far in Egypt, where Mr. Sisi remains firmly in control. Yet the attacks have badly rattled Egypt’ Christians, who account for about one-tenth of the country’ 92 million people, and raised urgent questions about Mr. Sisi’ ability to stem the violent tide.

“t shows a new focus on a soft targets for maximum carnage,”aid Mokhtar Awad, an expert on Egyptian militancy at George Washington University . “slamic State in Egypt is benefiting from new dedicated leadership and improved capabilities.”

The attack on Friday drew wide international condemnation. President Trump issued a statement decrying the “erciless slaughter of Christians”nd vowed to crush “vil organizations of terror.”he United Nations and Israel spoke out, as did Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Mr. Sisi is not lacking for powers to battle the Islamic State. After the last attack in April, when suicide bombers struck churches in Alexandria and Tanta on Palm Sunday , Mr. Sisi imposed a state of emergency across Egypt that is still in force.

The new measures give him new powers to silence the press and have accused terrorists tried in special courts. For all that, Christians are increasingly frustrated and worried by his failure to protect them, and some are considering moving abroad.

BANGKOK —n eruption of violence in the southern Philippines and suicide bombings in Indonesia this week highlight the growing threat posed by militant backers of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia.

While the timing of the Jakarta bombings and the fighting on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao appears to be coincidental, experts on terrorism have been warning for months that the Islamic State, also known as \b ISIS\b0 , has provided a new basis for cooperation among extremists in the region.

“etbacks in Syria and Iraq have heightened the importance of other theaters for ISIS, and in Southeast Asia, the focus is the Philippines,”aid Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, based in Jakarta. “ISIS supporters around the region have been urged to join the jihad in the Philippines if they can’ get to Syria, and to wage war at home if they can’ travel at all.”

There is no indication that this week’ violence was directed or coordinated by Islamic State leaders in the Middle East. Still, the attacks posed a test for the authorities in the Philippines and in Indonesia, the world’ largest Muslim-majority nation, as they confront like-minded extremists who support the creation of an Islamic state in Southeast Asia.

Clashes in Marawi, a city of about 200,000 on Mindanao, continued for a fourth day on Friday as government forces, using tanks and attack helicopters, tried to dislodge militants from at least two Islamist groups.

The government said it was conducting “urgical airstrikes”o drive out the militants, whose snipers held strategic positions in the city.

The fighting began on Tuesday after Philippine forces tried to capture Isnilon Hapilon, who has been designated by the Islamic State as its leader in the Philippines. He has long been associated with Abu Sayyaf, an Islamist-oriented kidnap-for-ransom gang that has made millions of dollars by taking hostages and sometimes killing them. The group beheaded a German hostage this year and two Canadians last year. The United States has offered a $5 million reward for Mr. Hapilon’ capture.

In moving to take Mr. Hapilon, the government underestimated the militants’trength, and the raid went awry. He escaped, and the Islamist forces took over much of the city, setting fire to a cathedral and a hospital and reportedly taking hostages, including a Roman Catholic priest.

The fighting led President Rodrigo Duterte to declare 60 days of martial law for all of Mindanao.

The government reports that more than 40 people have been killed in the fighting, including more than 30 militants, although official figures in the Philippines are notoriously unreliable.

Abu Sayyaf was joined by fighters from the smaller Maute group, which has also staged attacks in the southern Philippines. Both groups have pledged to support the Islamic State.

Underscoring the threat from Islamist militancy, officials said that Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans were fighting in Marawi alongside the local militants, and that six foreign fighters had been killed.

“hat’ happening in Mindanao is no longer a rebellion of Filipino citizens,”aid Jose Calida, the solicitor general of the Philippines. “t has transmogrified into an invasion by foreign terrorists who heeded the clarion call of the ISIS to go to the Philippines if they find difficulty in going to Iraq or Syria.”

In Jakarta, two suicide bombers attacked police officers Wednesday evening outside the Kampung Melayu bus terminal, a few minutes apart. Three police officers died, along with the two attackers.

Setyo Wasisto, a spokesman for the Indonesian police, said an identity card found at the scene bore the name of a man with known connections to the Islamic State. The authorities are conducting a DNA test to confirm whether he was one of the bombers, he said.

It was the worst attack by extremists since January 2016, when militants attacked a police post in Jakarta. The police said the attack was organized by an Indonesian member of the Islamic State in Syria. Four civilians were killed in that attack, along with four of the attackers.

About 500 Indonesians have tried to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State, but most were detained before getting there and were sent back to Indonesia. However, some Indonesians who succeeded in joining the Islamic State have played a key role in Syria in coordinating activities in the Philippines and Indonesia, Ms. Jones said.

In the past, the Indonesian leaders of three groups within the Islamic State competed with one another for resources to organize attacks, she said.

Zachary M. Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who specializes in Southeast Asian security issues, said that the Islamic State was happy to take responsibility for terrorist attacks in other countries, but that he believed the group’ focus on Southeast Asia had diminished as it faced military pressure from the United States and its allies in Iraq and Syria.

“outheast Asia was never a priority for ISIS,”e said, “nd it is hard for me to make the case that fighting for survival in Iraq and Syria, or at least trying not to lose any more territory, that they will stay focused on Southeast Asia.”

The southern Philippines, home to a sizable Muslim population in a mostly Catholic country, has long served as a base for Islamist extremists, including militants from Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries, who have taken refuge there or trained at remote jungle camps.

Together, Indonesia and the Philippines have nearly 25,000 islands and share a little-patrolled ocean border. Militants can easily travel by boat between the southern Philippines and eastern Indonesia without having to pass through immigration control.

Since the early 2000s, the United States has stationed military advisers in the southern Philippines to aid in the fight against Abu Sayyaf and other Islamic extremists.

Richard Javad Heydarian, a political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila, said that Mr. Duterte was under mounting pressure to address the crisis in his home island, Mindanao, and that he may need further assistance from Washington.

“s the first president from Mindanao, public expectations have been and continue to be high,”r. Heydarian said. “ounterterrorism will likely dominate his agenda in the short to medium run, and this will likely nudge him to solicit assistance from tried and tested allies like America.”

Rights activists, who are already alarmed by Mr. Duterte’ campaign against drugs that has claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people, are concerned that his declaration of martial law will lead to even more killing.

Mr. Duterte has threatened to expand martial law nationwide, an echo of the Marcos dictatorship, when the country lived under martial law for nine years. The period was marked by widespread abuses, extrajudicial killings, disappearances and torture.

“uterte’ martial law threatens military abuses in Mindanao that could rival the murderous ‘rug war’n urban areas,”aid Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.

Reporting was contributed by Felipe Villamor, Sol Vanzi and Aurora Almendral from Manila, and Fira Abdurachman from Jakarta, Indonesia.

LONDON —lthough the Iraqi military on Friday began leafleting areas of western Mosul still controlled by the Islamic State, warning people to evacuate because an offensive was imminent, the American military is not predicting a speedy resolution to the battle for the city.

Speaking at a news conference in London, Col. Ryan S. Dillon, the American coalition spokesman for Iraq and Syria, would not predict a timeline for the Iraqi military, supported by American advisers and air power, to finally oust the extremists. “ am confident they will retake Mosul,”e said. “his is inevitable, it will happen.”

\b ISIS\b0  militants overran the city of more than one million, as well as other large stretches of the country, over just a few days in June 2014. More than two years later, in October 2016, Iraqi forces trained and advised by Americans and other coalition countries began an offensive to retake the city. Iraqi officials predicted success within a few months, but Islamic State fighters have managed to hold onto important parts of the city’ west side, including its historic center.

Colonel Dillon declined to predict whether the Iraqis would retake the city within a year of the start of their offensive.

“hey will liberate Mosul —t’ just a matter of time when that’ going to happen —ut I’ not going to put a timeline on that for them,”e said. Colonel Dillon recently took over as spokesman for the anti-ISIS operations by the American military, based in Baghdad. He was on a visit to London Friday.

Colonel Dillon said the going had been slow in Mosul because of efforts to minimize civilian casualties, and because of the Islamic State’ determination to use human shields, booby traps and suicide bombers. “est Mosul is arguably the most complex and dangerous combat urban environment that any force has seen in decades,”e said.

The Islamic State’ force in the city has been reduced to only a couple of hundred, while estimates of the civilian population remaining there range from 250,000 to 550,000, he said. Territory held by the insurgents in the city has been reduced to about four square miles, Colonel Dillon.

In Syria, a coalition-supported offensive to capture the Islamic State’ declared capital, Raqqa, now involves 50,000 fighters with the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces, including more than 500 American advisers. Colonel Dillon said those forces were within two miles to the north of Raqqa now.

BANGKOK —he eruption of street fighting in the southern Philippines and a double suicide bombing in Indonesia this week highlight the growing threat posed by militant backers of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia as the extremist group inspires violence globally.

Mr. Duterte visited a military unit near Marawi on Friday and reminded troops that Mr. Hapilon was affiliated with the Islamic State. But he said he was willing to talk with the militants.

In Jakarta, two suicide bombers attacked police officers Wednesday evening outside the Kampung Melayu bus terminal a few minutes apart. Three police officers died, along with the two attackers.

MANILA —s fighting continued Friday between government forces and Islamic State-linked insurgents in the southern Philippines, the government said that foreign militants were among those taking part in the clashes.

Jose Calida, the government’ solicitor general, said Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans were fighting alongside local Abu Sayyaf and Maute group members in Marawi, a Muslim-majority city of about 200,000 people. The city, on the island of Mindanao, has been largely deserted since residents fled clashes  this week.

“hat’ happening in Mindanao is no longer a rebellion of Filipino citizens,”r. Calida said.

The intense fighting led President Rodrigo Duterte to declare martial law in the southern Philippines this week, and he warned that he could impose it on the whole country if the Islamist threat spread.

While Abu Sayyaf, the main group fighting the government, has pledged its allegiance to the Islamic State, it predates that group, and it has been behind a series of attacks across Mindanao in recent years.

The fighting broke out when government forces moved to capture the leader of an Abu Sayyaf faction, Isnilon Hapilon, after he had been spotted in Marawi this week. But government forces were surprised by the heavy resistance they encountered.

The rebels went on a rampage, burning several buildings and taking hostage a Roman Catholic priest and several parishioners. There was no word on their fate Friday, three days after they were kidnapped.

The fighting has resulted in the deaths of 31 militants, 11 soldiers and two police officers as of Thursday night. The government said at least six of the slain fighters were believed to be foreigners.

Reports of foreign militants fighting in Mindanao, however, are not new. Foreign jihadists were spotted in rebel camps in the south as long as two decades ago. Muslim rebel fighters, too, have been known to cross over to nearby Malaysia and Indonesia to train there.

Aid agencies began arriving in Marawi on Friday in an attempt to help people left behind in the city.

A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said they were assisting the local government and troops in evacuating residents and providing them with essentials like water.

But the British aid agency Oxfam said “ery little is known of the plight of civilians”ho chose to wait it out in Marawi, where sporadic clashes were continuing.

“side from sketchy reporting about men, women and children exposed to a higher risk of being killed and injured, there is no actual account of those individuals and families affected and information as to where they will go to for safe evacuation,”t said.

LIVE BRIEFING
Foreign Desk; SECT
Highlights: In Brussels, Trump Scolds Allies on Cost-Sharing, and Stays Vague on Article 5

On the fourth leg of a grueling overseas trip, President Trump lectured NATO allies in Brussels on not spending enough for collective defense, and declined to plainly endorse Article 5 of the alliance's founding treaty, which states that an attack on any member is an attack on all.

For some of the European leaders, testing Mr. Trump seemed to be as important as finding common ground with him, amid anxiety about their relationship with a leader who had dismissed the alliance as ''obsolete'' and called the Belgian capital a ''hellhole'' after a terrorist attack.

Earlier, Mr. Trump met with Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. Mr. Tusk said afterward that there were differences of opinion over Russia, but that when it came to Ukraine, ''it seems that we were on the same line.''

Analysts said expectations were low that Mr. Trump and European leaders would agree on issues like climate change, trade and terrorism. (He also shared an eyebrow-raising handshake with President Emmanuel Macron of France.)

In the wake of Mr. Trump's suggestions that the alliance was not doing enough against terrorism, NATO announced that it would formally join the fight against the Islamic State.

Mr. Trump chastises NATO allies on military spending.

If there was any real drama over Mr. Trump's visit, it concerned whether he would go off script on the question of Article 5. He had been expected to explicitly endorse the principle in a speech when he unveiled a Sept. 11 memorial -- a piece of twisted metal from the World Trade Center -- outside NATO's new building.

But in his speech before the leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, he did not explicitly do so. Instead, Mr. Trump offered a vague promise to ''never forsake the friends that stood by our side'' in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks -- a pledge that White House officials later said was an affirmation of mutual defense.

The only time NATO has invoked Article 5 was to defend the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks. More than 1,000 non-American soldiers from NATO countries have died in Afghanistan in the name of Article 5.

The leaders had also wanted him to say something critical about Russia and its annexation of Crimea, but Mr. Trump has been pretty quiet on that topic, too.

What he has been vocal about is pressing NATO allies to pay what he considers their fair share of the alliance's running costs. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, traveling with Mr. Trump to Brussels, said the president would have blunt words for the leaders of other NATO members on that issue.

And he did, criticizing the other leaders assembled behind him for not contributing 2 percent of their gross domestic product to their defense, as the allied nations had agreed.

--Steven Erlanger

Russia was a sticking point, Mr. Tusk says.

When Mr. Tusk emerged from an earlier meeting with Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker, there were clear signs that they had differences of opinion over Russia.

''Some issues remained open, like climate and trade,'' Mr. Tusk said shortly after the meeting at European Union headquarters here. ''And I am not 100 percent sure that we can say today -- 'we' means Mr. President and myself -- that we have a common position, common opinion, about Russia,'' he added.

Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, did say that ''when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, it seems that we were on the same line.''

The leaders also found agreement on counterterrorism. ''I'm sure that I don't have to explain why,'' said Mr. Tusk, in an apparent reference to the terrorist attack in Manchester, England.

But European leaders are trying to persuade Mr. Trump not to withdraw the United States from the 195-nation Paris Accord, one of several issues on the agenda for an organization that Mr. Trump has called into question with his support for Britain's decision to leave and for populist euroskeptics like Marine Le Pen, the French leader of the far-right National Front.

Mr. Juncker said agreement was reached during the meeting to hold talks on trade matters during ''the next few weeks, in order to come closer together.''

Mr. Juncker gave no indication whether the coming talks could unfreeze the efforts begun under President Obama to reach a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that would drastically lower trade and regulatory barriers between the European Union and the United States.

But Mr. Juncker also offered a characteristically droll remark when asked about his meeting with Mr. Trump: ''I hope he hasn't sent a tweet about me yet.''

--James Kanter

Trans-Atlantic tensions, and a white-knuckled handshake.

But if Mr. Trump's European hosts hoped that his visit to Brussels would thaw the ice left over from the dismissive comments he made about the European project during the 2016 campaign, the atmosphere before the morning meeting suggested the trans-Atlantic tensions hadn't entirely vanished.

As they waited for Mr. Trump and Mr. Tusk, the American and European delegations did not say a word to each another, clustering in groups on the opposite sides of a rectangular conference table.

After the meeting, Mr. Trump headed to the Belgian residence of the United States ambassador, where he had a working lunch with Mr. Macron.

Mr. Trump, who had appeared to favor Marine Le Pen, Mr. Macron's opponent, showered the French president with praise for his election win. Mr. Macron, he said, ''had a tremendous victory, all over the world they're talking about it.''

Mr. Macron, speaking in French, said at a news conference that there had been differences during his meeting with Mr. Trump, but a spirit of pragmatism, too.

''I met an effective and open partner,'' said Mr. Macron. ''We don't necessarily interpret things in the same way, but we were able to speak very frankly.''

He said there was agreement to strengthen the joint fight against terrorism. That was ''a step in the right direction,'' he said. The two leaders also discussed an ''inclusive diplomatic road map'' for Syria, Mr. Macron said.

Asked about whether he had persuaded Mr. Trump to maintain the United States' participation in the Paris climate agreement, Mr. Macron said he respected Mr. Trump's decision to review the agreement but also made clear that a large gap between the two sides remained.

But it was their handshake that raised eyebrows.

--Mark Landler and James Kanter

Meanwhile, Mr. Obama gets a warm welcome in Germany.

The former president basked in the affection of Berliners and returned the favor on Thursday during an appearance with the German chancellor, endorsing Mrs. Merkel's refugee policies as she seeks a fourth term. In the process, he took a swipe at his successor.

''We can't hide behind a wall,'' Mr. Obama said when discussing the difficulties of leading nations through war, peace, migration and climate change. His remark seemed clearly aimed at Mr. Trump, who has vowed to build a wall along the United States border with Mexico.

Mr. Trump was not mentioned once during the 90-minute Obama-Merkel appearance.

Mr. Obama, 55, and Ms. Merkel, 62, were celebrated by tens of thousands of people to Protestant church celebrations of 500 years since Martin Luther began the Reformation. Mr. Obama received an even warmer welcome than the German leader did, and stirred a particularly rousing reception when he mentioned his wife, Michelle.

The appearance affirmed Mr. Obama's status as Europe's favorite American leader. While he reminded his large audience (the event was broadcast live on German television) of how he had quested for peace, Mr. Trump was in Brussels urging the NATO alliance to do more in the war against the Islamic State.

--Alison Smale

NATO says it will formally join the coalition fight against ISIS.

The announcement by the Atlantic alliance's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, was another gesture toward Mr. Trump.

''This will send a strong political message of NATO's commitment to the fight against terrorism,'' Mr. Stoltenberg said. But a message is what it mostly was. The United States, after all, formed the coalition, which it leads and runs out of its military headquarters, without major NATO input, though numerous member nations are also part of the coalition fighting the Islamic State.

NATO has had a small mission in Iraq to train soldiers there and will enhance it, but will much change now that it has agreed to formally join the coalition? Probably not.

--Steven Erlanger

Belgians take to the streets in protest against Mr. Trump.

Amid the pomp and ceremony, however, ordinary Belgians gave Mr. Trump a rather chilly reception.

Thousands marched on Wednesday to protest his presence, carrying signs that read ''Solidarity with the women of the whole world,'' ''No ban, no wall'' and ''Trump go away.'' At one point, #TrumpNotWelcome was the No. 1 trending hashtag on Twitter in Belgium.

Five Greenpeace activists climbed a crane to hoist a sign saying ''Resist'' near the American Embassy.

And the Ancienne Belgique concert hall put up a sign that said, ''Don't duck for Donald.''

--Claire Barthelemy

The president's response on Manchester: 'We will win this fight' against terrorism.

Ahead of the NATO meeting, Mr. Trump met the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, on Wednesday and spoke at a news conference in which he denounced those who were behind the bombing attack in Manchester, England, that left 22 people dead, including children, and about 60 others injured.

After complaints from Britain, he also called for an investigation into the release of ''sensitive information'' to the news media about the investigation.

What do European Union leaders really want from Mr. Trump?

Simply put: More Mike Pence.

Ms. Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said at a news conference on Wednesday that she would welcome the same ''message of continuity'' about trans-Atlantic cooperation that Vice President Pence brought by visiting Brussels in February, soon after Mr. Trump took office.

Mr. Pence's visit was ''a clear sign'' of ''willingness to work together,'' Ms. Mogherini said.

Her comments represent a widely held hope in Brussels that Mr. Trump will avoid bashing the European project in favor of constructive dialogue on global challenges.

Ms. Mogherini said she wanted Mr. Trump to discuss carrying out the Paris agreement on climate change, which he has previously threatened to abandon, and investing in multilateral organizations like the United Nations, where the Trump administration wants further funding cuts.

MANCHESTER, England -- The British authorities intensified their search on Thursday for possible accomplices of the Manchester bomber, as questions emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the country's deadliest terrorist attack since 2005.

As early as 2011, Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old Briton identified as the bomber, had raised such serious concerns among acquaintances that they called an antiterrorism hotline to report that he held extremist views.

The government has said that MI5, the domestic intelligence agency, was aware of Mr. Abedi -- but only as a peripheral figure, and not someone whose behavior would have warranted immediate action.

Mr. Abedi set off a bomb Monday night as fans left a concert by the pop singer Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena, killing 22 people and injuring 64, many of them critically.

As the police conducted a series of house raids on Thursday in the Manchester area, the chief investigator said they were making headway in the investigation into the plot and had amassed important evidence. A man was arrested in the Moss Side area early Friday, according the police. Eight suspects were in custody. Two other people were released after being detained.

''I want to reassure people that the arrests that we have made are significant, and initial searches of premises have revealed items that we believe are very important to the investigation,'' Manchester's top police official, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, said at a news conference. ''These searches will take several days to complete, as you would expect. Therefore, there will be some disruption. However, it is very important that we continue with these searches.''

Officials in Turkey and Germany said on Thursday that Mr. Abedi had passed through airports in Istanbul and the German city of Düseldorf this month on his way back to Britain from Libya.

It did not appear that he had stayed very long or even left the airports in Turkey and Germany, but the German authorities were looking into a 2015 visit by Mr. Abedi to Frankfurt.

France's interior minister said on Wednesday that Mr. Abedi had ''most likely'' traveled to Syria, a stronghold of the Islamic State. But the Turkish authorities said they had no evidence that Mr. Abedi had passed through their country to travel to Syria.

Since the attack, Mr. Abedi's older brother, Ismail, has been arrested in Britain, while his younger brother, Hashem, and father have been detained in Libya.

A friend of the Abedi family, Salem Ammar, said in an interview that Mr. Abedi's father, Ramadan, had been so worried about his son's frame of mind in the months before the Manchester bombing that he pressured him to come to Libya, and briefly confiscated his passport.

''We were all surprised that he managed to take his passport,'' Mr. Ammar said by telephone from Tripoli, the Libyan capital.

Mr. Ammar said that Salman Abedi was distraught after a friend, Abdul Wahab Hafidah, was killed in May 2016 in what the authorities took to be an act of gang violence. Mr. Hafidah was close with Salman Abedi's brother Hashem.

''I was told his radicalization started in England shortly after the murder of Hafidah,'' Mr. Ammar said. ''Some of the kids there were very upset about it, and that is how it started.''

Mr. Ammar said he was shocked because Mr. Abedi's father, an employee of the interior minister in Tripoli, ''is moderate and everyone knows that.'' He added, ''I still can't believe that his son grew up to be this person.''

Ramadan Abedi, the father, fled Libya during the rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 1993 -- the year before Salman was born, in Britain -- but returned after Colonel Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011.

In Manchester, Abdullah Muhsin Norris, the imam at a mosque where members of the Abedi family worshiped, said that Salman Abedi would sit around and read the Quran, avoiding other congregants. He was so quiet and withdrawn that he would have escaped notice, Mr. Norris said, but for the fact that Mr. Abedi twice committed minor infractions: lingering in the mosque after dawn prayers and wearing shoes while on his way to the mosque's lavatory.

On one occasion, the young man responded angrily when chastised, telling the imam, ''Don't shout at me,'' according to Mr. Norris. He was ''acting like a child, and should know better,'' the imam recalled.

The authorities are also looking into Mr. Abedi's relationships with several known militants, including Raphael Hostey, an Islamic State recruiter who was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. Mr. Hostey's younger brother insisted on Thursday that his brother did not know Mr. Abedi, and then sped off on a moped.

Hamed El-Said, a professor of international political economy at Manchester Metropolitan University and an acquaintance of the Abedi family, said he believed the young man had fallen under the sway of peers.

''This is obviously another example of social radicalization with a small group of friends over the past two or three years -- the question is where he met these people,'' he said. ''He is gullible, he is naïe, he is disconnected, he's one of those individuals who, when you tell him something, might believe it. He would be the perfect mule for ISIS,'' he added, using an acronym for the Islamic State.

As the authorities worked to piece together Mr. Abedi's past, Britain paused to grieve.

Queen Elizabeth II visited teenagers at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital who had been injured in the blast, and she described the attack as ''very wicked.''

At 11 a.m., much of the nation, from the Scottish Highlands to the City of London, observed a moment of silence to honor the victims.

Mancunians, as Manchester's residents are known, filled St. Ann's Square in the city center for a memorial service. They laid flowers, stuffed toys and cards of condolence on a flowing makeshift altar.

After the clock had tolled and the minute of silence had ended, someone in the back of the crowd began to sing ''Don't Look Back in Anger'' by the band Oasis, which was formed in Manchester.

The group singalong was followed by rounds of applause and shouts of ''Manchester, we love Manchester!'' People continued to stand together around the flowers for another 20 minutes or so after the vigil had ended.

As the country mourned, politics intervened: The campaigning in advance of the parliamentary election scheduled for June 8 resumed after a brief hiatus following the attack. Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, went to Brussels for a NATO summit meeting, bearing a complaint for President Trump that American intelligence officials had leaked details about the investigation into the attack. Mr. Trump, in turn, called for an inquiry into those leaks, as his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, prepared to visit London on Friday for what the British Foreign Office called ''an expression of U.K.-U.S. solidarity.''

Pentagon Inquiry Blames  ISIS  for Civilian Deaths in U.S. Strike on Mosul

WASHINGTON -- An American airstrike in March killed more than 100 Iraqi civilians by inadvertently setting off a large amount of explosives that Islamic State fighters had placed in a building in Mosul, according to a long-awaited military investigation made public on Thursday.

Critics have said the March 17 airstrike demonstrated that the United States has been too quick to use air power in a congested city filled with hundreds of thousands of civilians.

But the Pentagon investigation put the primary blame on the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, while asserting that the American-led coalition that is fighting the militants has drawn some lessons from the episode and has adjusted its tactics and procedures.

''This investigation determined that ISIS deliberately staged explosives and snipers to harm civilians,'' said Brig. Gen. Matthew C. Isler, who oversaw the investigation.

The investigation concluded that 105 civilians were killed: 101 in the building that was bombed, which was owned by a respected elder who invited people in the neighborhood to shelter there, and four in an adjacent structure. Thirty-six civilians who were believed to have been in the area have not been accounted for.

The toll is one of the highest in the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, though the investigation asserts that jihadists' explosives were mainly at fault.

The battle for Mosul has been daunting for Iraqi forces, who have had about 980 troops killed and more than 6,000 wounded in the seven-month operation. The current challenge for the Iraqi forces is to defeat militants who appear to be determined to fight to the death in western Mosul, known for its narrow streets and difficult terrain. It is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians.

To make headway in taking the city, Iraqi forces have appealed for quicker airstrikes from coalition warplanes to protect them when they come under fire. Last year, the American-led command obliged by giving American advisers in the field the authority to call in bombing attacks without obtaining the approval of a brigadier general or ranking officer in a command center in Erbil, Iraq.

The March 17 strike, however, was approved by the Erbil-based command center, according to an unclassified summary of the investigation.

Though that additional authority for calling in airstrikes was granted under the Obama administration, the stepped-up pace of military operations under President Trump, which carries the potential for more rapid gains on the battlefield as well as increased risk of civilian casualties, has also drawn attention.

According to the investigation, the March episode began that morning when two Islamic State snipers in the city's Mosul Jidideh section began firing at troops from Iraq's Counterterrorism Service, which was fighting its way into western Mosul.

An Iraqi forward air controller called for the strike, which was approved by more senior Iraqi officers and coalition advisers. In Erbil, coalition officers evaluated the situation and decided to send an American plane to drop a single GBU-38 munition, which carries nearly 200 pounds of explosives.

The aim was to produce a blast by using a bomb with a delayed fuse that would damage only the top floor and front of the building, which was described as a well-built, two-story concrete structure, and kill the snipers. The bomb that was dropped, General Isler said, was not strong enough to have taken down the building.

But the blast, shortly before 8:30 a.m., set off the explosive material that Islamic State fighters had placed in on the second floor of the structure, causing it to collapse. Analysis of the debris found residue of explosive materials, including nitroglycerin, that Islamic State fighters are known to use but that are not used in the GBU-38.

General Isler said in a briefing for reporters that his assessment was that the Islamic State deliberately created a situation in which the United States would strike the building and set off the explosives, which he said were four times as powerful as the bomb that was dropped.

Neither the American-led coalition nor Iraqi forces were aware that civilians and explosives were in the building, the investigation concluded.

According to accounts from neighbors, the civilians went to the building voluntarily because it had thick walls and was one of the best constructed in the area; they took refuge in the basement and on the first floor to get away from the fighting.

The American-led coalition was not aware that civilians had gone there, perhaps because bad weather interfered with reconnaissance in the two days leading up to the strike. Nor did Iraqi forces always have a clear view of the area around the building.

The general said it was possible that civilians in the building were held against their will after they took sanctuary, though there was no proof of that. According to General Isler, residents of the adjacent building were warned by Islamic State fighters not to leave their home.

Amnesty International urged the American-led coalition to show much greater restraint in using firepower inside Mosul. In addition to using airstrikes, American forces have been firing artillery and surface-to-surface Himars rockets at targets in the city.

''We are curious to know whether any lessons were learned and what steps were taken to ensure such horrors do not occur again,'' Amnesty International said in a statement. ''As long as the conflict in Iraq is still raging, we call on Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces to desist from using explosive weapons with wide area effects, including artillery and mortars in crowded residential areas and to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties.''

General Isler said the American-led coalition had adjusted its tactics now that it had concluded the Islamic State was prepared to bait the coalition into attacking civilians.

''We look for ISIS moving civilians and creating entrapment of civilians,'' he said. But he would not detail how the tactics had been adjusted, saying the changes were being kept classified so the Islamic State would not know them.

A 70-Year History Lesson in Photojournalism

When the International Center of Photography reopened last year in its new home on the Bowery, it seemed to be swerving into a new lane -- or, perhaps, careering off the road altogether. New York's leading photography institution, it opened uptown in 1974, with a mandate from its founder, Cornell Capa, to showcase photojournalism, documentary images and other kinds of ''concerned photography.'' But since then, the medium of photography has fractured; lens-based imagery has moved from the darkroom to the social media screen; and the center has changed, too. The new location includes no space for its permanent collection -- those 200,000 prints are out in Jersey City -- and its first show was a digital hodgepodge that drew as many snipes as cheers.

So ''Magnum Manifesto,'' the museum's rewarding summer exhibition, is something of a #TBT, to use that most nostalgic of Instagram hashtags. This 70-year showcase of Magnum Photos, the granddaddy of photojournalism agencies -- whose founders included Capa's brother Robert, who shot the much-debated image of a dying Republican soldier in the Spanish Civil War -- turns back to printed images and published books, made by professionals shooting with high-end kits. The 75 photographers include such veterans as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Elliott Erwitt and Susan Meiselas; more recent stars like Martin Parr and Alec Soth; and promising younger members like the South African photographer Mikhael Subotzky. It adds up to a fine history lesson, but also offers a model for how this museum can pursue the necessary work of thinking about other, newer kinds of images.

Magnum was founded in 1947 as a collective of independent photojournalists, ready to document the world with new, lightweight cameras, notably rough-and-tough Leicas loaded with high-speed 35-millimeter film. ''Magnum Manifesto'' thus opens with a wall of small black-and-white photographs attesting to a new postwar order: a war crimes trial in Dachau, the United Nations General Assembly in session, flag-waving rebels in Algiers, Peróists demonstrating en masse in Buenos Aires. In those first decades, the Magnum aesthetic was one of humanistic universalism, and photography offered a lingua franca to imagine a new world. Magnum's images would appear in such magazines as Look, in the United States, or Point de Vue, in France.

True to the agency's name -- a magnum is an oversize bottle of champagne, but also a cartridge of bullets -- Magnum in its early days was a collective of brash individuals whose images sought to distill the chaos of life into precise, unforgettable instants. Cartier-Bresson, who had escaped from a German prison camp during the war, was a master at that; in a washed-out shot here from 1951, a lone woman crossing the street in London manages to convey the whole of the Blitz and postwar privation. Constantine Manos, a South Carolina photographer who deserves far more renown, shot a moving series of the daily life of an African-American child in 1952, when Mr. Manos was just a teenager himself.

The hunger for what Cartier-Bresson called ''the decisive moment'' endured in the next generation of Magnum photographers, including Danny Lyon, whose pictures of inmates in a Texas jail still shock, and Raymond Depardon, who portrayed patients in an Italian psychiatric hospital. Yet the late '60s also saw a more restless, troubled vernacular arise among Magnum's members, especially the Americans. Paul Fusco, shooting in color, traveled in 1968 on the funeral train bearing Robert F. Kennedy's coffin to Washington; the expectant mourners are a blurry, betrayed collective, with none of the specificity you'll find in Cartier-Bresson or Robert Capa. Charles Harbutt, a photographer and former president of Magnum, rigged up a slot machine to three slide projectors for a 1969 exhibition in New York. Visitors pulled the arm and saw photographs from ''America in Crisis'' flicker past: If you hit three Nixons, you won a prize. (The reproduction at the center works quite nicely, though I never hit the jackpot.)

Still, you've got to make a living. Magnum is a commercial agency, not an artistic collective, and one of the surprises of this exhibition is a wall of glossy corporate annual reports, for such companies as the Bank of New York and Goldman Sachs. The Seagram report of 1979, shot in luscious color by Burt Glinn, features a smiling couple enjoying cocktails in front of their Frank Stella painting, and three gents downing scotch and martinis outside the Toronto City Hall. Those projects helped pay the bills for other, more personal endeavors, including photobooks of the Iranian Revolution and other current affairs -- evoked here through half a dozen short films, with hand models turning pages.

Is there any function for reportage photography today, now that everyone carries a cameraphone, and every triumph or disaster is instantly captured and broadcast? A new generation of Magnum photographers is trying, and its members embrace a more artistic and individual language than that of their predecessors. Mr. Subotzky's outstanding, voluminous project ''Ponte City,'' done in collaboration with the artist Patrick Waterhouse, explores the tallest residential tower in Johannesburg, which was built for white residents during apartheid and later became a high-rise slum and drug den. In addition to photographs of the tower's residents and architecture, the project also includes more idiosyncratic images of flickering TVs and stained posters, assembled into more than a dozen pamphlets.

Other members have taken similarly subjective stances. Paolo Pellegrin documents the continuing refugee crisis in the Mediterranean by picturing not bodies, but waves. Alessandra Sanguinetti has shot the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France, after the terrorist attack of last summer, as a nearly abstract blackout.

''Magnum Manifesto'' has been organized by three French scholars: Cléent Chéoux, who recently left the Pompidou Center in Paris to become the senior curator of photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the historian and Magnum specialist Clara Bouveresse; and Pauline Vermare, an associate curator at the center. Its principal accomplishment, beyond the archival discoveries, is that it presents photography as neither independent art nor mere documentation, but as something in between, plugged into the world while still obeying its own rules. The game now for the center is to bring the same rigor displayed in this show to its presentations of other kinds of images: ISIS videos and Snapchat filters, drone sights and selfies.

MANCHESTER, England —he British authorities intensified their search on Thursday for possible accomplices of the Manchester bomber, as questions emerged about whether more could have been done to stop him from carrying out the country’ deadliest terrorist attack since 2005.

As early as 2011, Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old Briton who has been identified as the bomber, had raised such serious concerns among acquaintances that they called an antiterrorism hotline to report that he held extremist views.

The government has said that MI5, the domestic intelligence agency, was aware of Mr. Abedi —ut only as a peripheral figure, and not someone whose behavior would have warranted immediate action.

Mr. Abedi set off a bomb Monday night as fans left a concert by the pop singer Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena, killing 22 people and injuring 64, many of them critically.

As the police conducted a series of house raids on Thursday in the Manchester area, the chief investigator said they were making headway in the investigation into the plot: Eight suspects were in custody, and officers had amassed important evidence.

“ want to reassure people that the arrests that we have made are significant, and initial searches of premises have revealed items that we believe are very important to the investigation,”anchester’ top police official, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, said at a news conference. “hese searches will take several days to complete, as you would expect. Therefore, there will be some disruption. However, it is very important that we continue with these searches.”

Officials in Turkey and Germany said on Thursday that Mr. Abedi had passed through airports in Istanbul and the German city of Düseldorf this month on his way back to Britain from Libya.

It did not appear that he had stayed very long or even left the airports in Turkey and Germany, but the German authorities were looking into a 2015 visit by Mr. Abedi to Frankfurt.

France’ interior minister said on Wednesday that Mr. Abedi had “ost likely”raveled to Syria, a stronghold of the Islamic State. But the Turkish authorities said they had no evidence that Mr. Abedi had passed through their country to travel to Syria.

Since the attack, Mr. Abedi’ older brother, Ismail, has been arrested in Britain, while his younger brother, Hashem, and father have been detained in Libya.

A friend of the Abedi family, Salem Ammar, said in an interview that Mr. Abedi’ father, Ramadan, had been so worried about his son’ frame of mind in the months before the Manchester bombing that he pressured him to come to Libya, and briefly confiscated his passport.

“e were all surprised that he managed to take his passport,”r. Ammar said by telephone from Tripoli, the Libyan capital.

Mr. Ammar said that Salman Abedi was distraught after a friend, Abdul Wahab Hafidah, was killed in May 2016 in what the authorities took to be an act of gang violence. Mr. Hafidah was close with Salman Abedi’ brother Hashem.

“ was told his radicalization started in England shortly after the murder of Hafidah,”r. Ammar said. “ome of the kids there were very upset about it, and that is how it started.”

Mr. Ammar said he was shocked because Mr. Abedi’ father, an employee of the interior minister in Tripoli, “s moderate and everyone knows that.”e added, “ still can’ believe that his son grew up to be this person.”

Ramadan Abedi, the father, fled Libya during the rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 1993 —he year before Salman was born, in Britain —ut returned after Colonel Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011.

In Manchester, Abdullah Muhsin Norris, the imam at a mosque where members of the Abedi family worshiped, said that Salman Abedi would sit around and read the Quran, avoiding other congregants. He was so quiet and withdrawn that he would have escaped notice, Mr. Norris said, but for the fact that Mr. Abedi twice committed minor infractions: lingering in the mosque after dawn prayers and wearing shoes while on his way to the mosque’ lavatory.

On one occasion, the young man responded angrily when chastised, telling the imam, “on’ shout at me,”ccording to Mr. Norris. He was “cting like a child, and should know better,”he imam recalled.

The authorities are also looking into Mr. Abedi’ relationships with several known militants, including Raphael Hostey, an Islamic State recruiter who was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. Mr. Hostey’ younger brother insisted on Thursday that his brother did not know Mr. Abedi, and then sped off on a moped.

Hamed El-Said, a professor of international political economy at Manchester Metropolitan University and an acquaintance of the Abedi family, said he believed the young man had fallen under the sway of peers.

“his is obviously another example of social radicalization with a small group of friends over the past two or three years —he question is where he met these people,”e said. “e is gullible, he is naïe, he is disconnected, he’ one of those individuals who, when you tell him something, might believe it. He would be the perfect mule for ISIS,”e added, using an acronym for the Islamic State.

As the authorities worked to piece together Mr. Abedi’ past, Britain paused to grieve.

Queen Elizabeth II visited teenagers injured in the blast at the Royal Manchester Children’ Hospital, and she described the attack as “ery wicked.”

At 11 a.m., much of the nation, from the Scottish Highlands to the City of London, observed a moment of silence to honor the victims.

Mancunians, as Manchester’ residents are known, filled St. Ann’ Square in the city center for a memorial service. They laid flowers, stuffed toys and cards of condolence on a flowing makeshift altar.

After the clock had tolled and the minute of silence had ended, someone in the back of the crowd began to sing “on’ Look Back in Anger”y the band Oasis, which was formed in Manchester.

The group singalong was followed by rounds of applause and shouts of “anchester, we love Manchester!”eople continued to stand together around the flowers for another 20 minutes or so after the vigil had ended.

As the country mourned, politics intervened: The campaigning in advance of the parliamentary election scheduled for June 8 resumed after a brief hiatus following the attack. Britain’ prime minister, Theresa May, went to Brussels for a NATO summit meeting, bearing a complaint for President Trump that American intelligence officials had leaked details about the investigation into the attack. Mr. Trump, in turn, called for an inquiry into those leaks, as his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, prepared to visit London on Friday for what the British Foreign Office called “n expression of U.K.-U.S. solidarity.”

Live Updates: Trump Is in Brussels, and NATO Officials Are Anxious

•resident Trump is in Brussels on Thursday, on the fourth leg of a grueling first overseas trip as head of state. He will meet with NATO leaders, and analysts say anxiety is high but expectations are low.

 It is his first visit to the Belgian capital —eadquarters of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization —ince calling it a “ellhole” after coordinated suicide bombings there last year.

•r. Trump’ arrival was greeted by scattered protests and a sign saying, “esist” near the United States Embassy.

•n the wake of Mr. Trump’ criticism that the alliance should do more against terrorism, NATO announced that it would formally join the fight against the Islamic State.

•igh on his agenda is a summit meeting with European Union leaders including Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.

•uropean leaders’ain hope is that Mr. Trump will explicitly endorse Article 5 of the Atlantic alliance’ founding treaty, which states the principle that an attack on any member is an attack on all.

NATO leaders are holding their breath: Will Mr. Trump endorse Article 5?

If there’ any real drama in Mr. Trump’ visit, besides wondering if he will go off script, it will be his comments when he unveils a 9/11 memorial — piece of twisted metal from the World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks —utside NATO’ new building.

(Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will unveil a chunk of the Berlin Wall, which came down in 1989, to symbolize how the alliance kept the peace during the Cold War. Potentially awkward: Mrs. Merkel will meet former President Barack Obama before meeting Mr. Trump.)

While Mr. Trump has decided that the alliance isn’ really obsolete, as he once said, he has never publicly committed to Article 5. His vice president and defense secretary have done so, but Mr. Trump has been alarmingly silent on the issue.

But he is expected to finally do so on Thursday, White House officials said, since the only time NATO has ever invoked Article 5 was to defend the United States after the 9/11 attacks. More than 1,000 non-American soldiers from NATO countries have died in Afghanistan in the name of Article 5.

But one never knows exactly what Mr. Trump will say, and NATO officials will not breathe easy until Mr. Trump actually utters the words. Of course, NATO leaders would also like him to say something critical about Russia and its annexation of Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has been pretty quiet on that topic, too.

—teven Erlanger

NATO says it will formally join the coalition fight against ISIS.

In the wake of Mr. Trump’ criticism that the Atlantic alliance should do more against terrorism, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has announced that the alliance would join the global coalition that is fighting Islamic State militants, another gesture toward Mr. Trump.

“his will send a strong political message of NATO’ commitment to the fight against terrorism,”r. Stoltenberg said. But a message is what it mostly was. The United States, after all, formed the coalition, which it leads and runs out of its military headquarters, without major NATO input, though numerous member nations are also part of the coalition fighting the Islamic State.

NATO has had a small mission in Iraq to train soldiers there and will enhance it, but will much change now it has agreed to formally join the coalition? Probably not.

—teven Erlanger

What else do European Union leaders want from Mr. Trump?

Simply put: More Mike Pence.

Federica Mogherini, the European Union’ foreign policy chief, said at a news conference on Wednesday that she would welcome the same “essage of continuity”bout trans-Atlantic cooperation that Vice President Pence brought by visiting Brussels in February, soon after Mr. Trump took office.

Mr. Pence’ visit was “ clear sign”f “illingness to work together,”s. Mogherini said.

Her comments represent a widely held hope in Brussels that Mr. Trump will avoid bashing the European project in favor of constructive dialogue on global challenges.

Ms. Mogherini, accompanied by Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, will attend a meeting on Thursday morning along with Mr. Trump, Mr. Tusk and Mr. Juncker.

Ms. Mogherini said she wanted Mr. Trump to discuss carrying out the Paris agreement on climate change, which in the past he has previously threatened to abandon, and investing in multilateral organizations like the United Nations, where the Trump administration wants further funding cuts.

Even if the Trump administration was set on revising American policies, Ms. Mogherini said, it was important to have “n open and constructive dialogue.”

—ames Kanter

The president’ response on Manchester: ‘e will win this fight’gainst terrorism.

Ahead of the NATO meeting, Mr. Trump met the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, on Wednesday and spoke at a news conference in which he denounced those who were behind the bombing attack in Manchester, England, that left 22 people dead, including children, and about 60 others injured.

Belgians take to the streets in protest against Mr. Trump.

Amid the pomp and ceremony and red carpet unfurled for his arrival, ordinary Belgians gave Mr. Trump a chilly reception, however.

Thousands marched on Wednesday to protest his presence, carrying signs that read, “olidarity with the women of the whole world”nd “rump go away.”

Activists climbed a crane to hoist a sign saying, “ESIST”ear the American Embassy.

And the famous concert hall Ancienne Belgique put up a sign that said, “Don’ duck for Donald.”

—laire Barthelemy

Tusk: ‘e should watch over our legacy of freedom together.’

Mr. Trump’ formal introduction to the complexities of the European Union began with a cordial handshake a walk through a forest of flags.

Met by Mr. Tusk, the president of the European Council, the American president was guided along a red carpet through the newly completed headquarters of the bloc, where each of the 28 member states flies its national flag. (Britain, of course, is negotiating its divorce from the bloc.)

The building, called the Europa, is meant to represent a fresh start for the Union, the organization that Mr. Trump has called into question with his support for Britain’ decision to leave and for populist Eurosceptics like Marine Le Pen, the French leader of the far-right National Front.

Mr. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister and a staunch defender of democracy and openness, was expected to meet with Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker for about an hour. Mr. Tusk, who warned this year that Mr. Trump was threatening Europe’ stability, made his priorities for the meeting clear at a prize-giving ceremony the previous evening.

It was, Mr. Tusk told his audience, “mportant to keep our relations with the United States as close as possible and as long as possible —t least for as long as this value remains a priority also on the other side of the Atlantic.”

Mr. Tusk said he would try to convince Mr. Trump “hat euroatlantism is primarily cooperation of the free for the sake of freedom; that if we want to prevent the scenario that has already been named by our opponents not so long ago in Munich as the ‘ost-West world order,’e should watch over our legacy of freedom together.”

The Force drew us in as much as anyone: Over the past 40 years, The Times has published thousands of articles about “tar Wars”nd the universe that surrounds it.

Some now seem quaint: In a prerelease interview, George Lucas described Chewbacca as “ cross between a large bear, a dog and a monkey.”Chewie, as we know now, is a 200-year-old Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk and one of the greatest sidekicks in the history of film.)

Other reports were serious: We covered President Ronald Reagan’ “tar Wars”ntimissile system in the 1980s, the “tar Wars”“iracy menace”f bootleg films in Hong Kong, and the obituaries of franchise stars like Sir Alec Guinness, in 2000, and Carrie Fisher, in December.

We also tried to be playful. We covered the recent campaign to make Jediism a religion, and the “tar Wars”socks worn by the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.

And maybe we got a little obsessed, too. Last year, we offered “tar Wars”eaching ideas —rom “ackle Shakespeare With Yoda, You Will”o an economics primer, “he Death Star, Too Big to Fail?”

In any case, may The Force be with you.

U.S.-Russia Hotline Is Buzzing Even After Strike on Syria

WASHINGTON —fter American Navy destroyers fired dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield last month, fears emerged that Russia would respond by cutting off communications designed to prevent unintended confrontations in the skies over Syria, where both countries are conducting air campaigns.

More than six weeks later, however, the American and Russian militaries are still using a shared hotline to avoid conflicts involving their air operations over Syria. In fact, the number of calls has been on the rise.

“n the pure quantity of phone calls, it increased,”Lt. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, the top American air commander in the Middle East, told Pentagon reporters on Wednesday.

This does not signal that American and Russian diplomats are anywhere near agreement on how to end the conflict in Syria or on the future of President Bashar al-Assad. Rather, it indicates that both nations’ilitary officers are trying to manage the risks of an inadvertent conflict in the increasingly crowded airspace over Syria, which American and allied warplanes have shared with Syrian, Russian, Turkish and Israeli planes.

American and Russian officers started talking to each other after the Russian intervention in Syria began in 2015. The two sides do not coordinate strategy, but they have shared information to prevent midair collisions and other problems using a phone line that connects Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the command center of the American-led air war coalition, with the Russian base in Latakia, Syria.

The United States used the hotline to alert the Russians shortly before the April 7 attack on an airfield that Syrian planes had used to mount a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 civilians. As many as 100 Russian troops were believed to be at the airfield, though the Americans took pains not to target them, and none were hurt.

Angry that Syria, their ally, had been targeted, Russian officials threatened to suspend an agreement the United States and Russia had reached on flight safety.

But the Russians appear to have concluded that the cruise missile attack was a one-time operation and not the beginning of a broader military effort to dislodge Mr. Assad from power.

The American military wanted to keep the communications going so it could continue airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria without coming under fire by Syrian or Russian air defenses.

“e have had to increase the amount of deconfliction work we’e doing with the Russians given the tighter airspace that we’e now working ourselves through,”eneral Harrigian said.

Tensions between the two sides remain. On May 9, a Russian fighter harassed an American KC-10 refueling tanker, an encounter that General Harrigian described as an “nprofessional”ntercept. He said the American officers had raised the episode with the Russians, who acknowledged the problem.

Some of the conversations with the Russians, he noted, have been at relatively senior levels, led on the coalition side by a major general who serves as General Harrigian’ deputy.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has also taken steps to expand communication with the Russians. Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the chief planning officer on the Joint Chiefs’taff, has been talking to his Russian counterpart, General Dunford said last week.

The hotline figured in a recent episode in which a convoy of Shiite militia fighters that support Mr. Assad and are backed by Iran headed toward a garrison at al-Tanf, where American and allied Special Operations forces have been training Syrian fighters opposed to the Islamic State.

Armed with a bulldozer, an excavator and a tank, some of the militia fighters split off from the main group and began to build a small outpost that the Americans concluded was too close to al-Tanf for comfort. After warning shots failed to get the militia to leave, the Americans carried out an airstrike.

Now American officers are talking to their Russian counterparts, who they hope will dissuade the militia from trying something similar again.

“e’e continuing to ensure that, via the Russians, they understand our intent is for them not to threaten us,”eneral Harrigian said.

■ Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain  said she would confront President Trump over leaks by American intelligence officials about the bombing investigation.

■ The New York Times was given access to photographs of materials found at the scene of the Manchester bombing that show a detonator, shrapnel and a battery . Other news organizations, like CBS and NBC, had been among the first to reveal the name of the bomber, Salman Abedi .

■ The hunt continued for the “etwork”hat might have helped Mr. Abedi , as the authorities scrambled to avert another attack and to find a possible bombmaker who might have helped Mr. Abedi assemble the sophisticated device he used.

■ Mr. Abedi’ younger brother, Hashem, 20, and father, Ramadan , have been arrested in Libya by a powerful Islamist militia that has accused the brother of being a member of the Islamic State. Salman Abedi had recently traveled to Libya, his family said, and he may have visited Syria as well. Both countries are strongholds for extremist groups.

■ Four more victims  have been identified: a young couple, Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19; Eilidh MacLeod, 14; and Elaine McIver, an off-duty police officer.

■ The American pop singer Ariana Grande is suspending her tour  until at least June 5. It was after her concert in Manchester that the terrorist attack occurred.

View more photographs from the investigation and aftermath of the attack here .

Eight Men in Custody in Connection With Attack

At an early afternoon news conference, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins of the Greater Manchester Police said that eight men had been arrested in connection with the attack on Monday. The arrests took place in Manchester, the town of Wigan to the northwest, and to the south in the town of Nuneaton, which is near the city of Birmingham. A woman who was arrested on Wednesday has been released.

“ want to reassure people that the arrests that we have made are significant, and initial searches of premises have revealed items that we believe are very important to the investigation,”hief Constable Hopkins said. “hese searches will take several days to complete, as you would expect. Therefore will there will be some disruption. However, it is very important that we continue with these searches.”

Army Bomb Experts Destroy Suspicious Package

At 10:54 a.m. on Thursday, the Manchester police announced  that an army bomb disposal unit was heading toward Linby Street  in the city’ Hulme neighborhood, just west of the city center. Helicopters flew overhead and sirens blared; some of the commotion could be heard as far away as St. Ann’ Square, where Mancunians gathered to observe the national minute of silence at 11 a.m. A half-hour later, the police announced  that the “he incident has now been deemed safe”nd that the security cordon had been removed.

Bomber Passed Through Turkey and Germany Before The Attack

Officials said on Thursday that Mr. Abedi passed through airports in Istanbul and in Düseldorf, Germany, before the attack.

A Turkish official said that Mr. Abedi had been in transit at Istanbul Airport, possibly after arriving from Libya.

A German intelligence official said that Mr. Abedi passed through Düseldorf airport last week. He arrived from Turkey and continued to Manchester without leaving the transit zone.

Focus, a German magazine that reported that Mr. Abedi, the bomber, had passed through the Düseldorf Airport four days before the attack, also said that he had flown from Frankfurt to Britain in 2015.

Queen Elizabeth II Visits Victims at Manchester Hospital

Queen Elizabeth II visited the Royal Manchester Children’ Hospital, which treated young victims of the attack. Royal officials posted three images of the queen meeting with teenagers who were injured in the explosion. The youngest of them was Amy Barlow, from Rawtenstall, England.

The queen called Ms. Grande “ very good singer,”nd described the attack as “readful,”n video footage broadcast by Sky News. She added that the attack was “ery wicked.”

Theresa May to Discuss Intelligence Leaks With Donald Trump to Discuss Intelligence Leaks With

Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said on Thursday that she would confront President Trump in Brussels over leaks, attributed to the United States government , about the British investigation into Monday’ bombing in Manchester.

British officials have blamed leaks for reports in the American news media revealing the name of the Manchester bomber before the British authorities were ready to do so, and for disclosing certain details of the investigation, including forensic photographs of the crime scene.

Mrs. May, who will talk with Mr. Trump on Thursday afternoon at a NATO summit meeting in Brussels , said she would “ake clear to President Trump that intelligence which is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure.”

Britain and the United States have perhaps the most intimate intelligence cooperation in the world, but British officials are complaining that the disclosures could harm the investigation.

The BBC reported  that the Manchester police would no longer share details of the investigation with American counterparts. The National Police Chiefs’ouncil said that the “nauthorized disclosure of potential evidence”bout the bombing “ndermines our investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families.”

The first disclosures came when American television networks, in particular NBC and CBS , revealed the name of the Manchester bomber, Salman Abedi, citing American officials. (The name had also been circulating on social media.) Then, on Wednesday, The New York Times published crime scene photographs  of the bomber’ detonator and parts of the bomb itself. The Times report also pointed out precisely where the bomb had been placed. The Times did not cite its sources, but attributed its account to “reliminary information gathered by British authorities.”

On Wednesday morning, before The Times published its disclosure, Home Secretary Amber Rudd  told the BBC  that she was irritated by the disclosure of the bomber’ identity against the wishes of the British authorities.

“he British police have been very clear that they want to control the flow of information in order to protect operational integrity, the element of surprise, so it is irritating if it gets released from other sources, and I have been very clear with our friends that should not happen again,”s. Rudd said.

—teven Erlanger

The Times’ Response on Manchester Coverage

The New York Times released the following statement about its publication on Wednesday of an article and photographs of evidence collected at the crime scene of the Manchester bombing:

The images and information presented were neither graphic nor disrespectful of victims, and consistent with the common line of reporting on weapons used in horrific crimes, as The Times and other media outlets have done following terrorist acts around the world, from Boston to Paris to Baghdad, and many places in between.

Our mission is to cover news and inform our readers. We have strict guidelines on how and in what ways we cover sensitive stories. Our coverage of Monday’ horrific attack has been both comprehensive and responsible.

We cover stories about terrorism from all angles. Not only stories about victims but also how terrorist groups work, their sources of funding, how they recruit. Acts of terrorism have tremendous impact on how we live, on how we are governed and how we interact as people, communities and nations. At times the process of reporting this coverage comes at personal risk to our reporters. We do it because it is core to our mission.

Abedi’ Brother and Father Arrested in Libya

A powerful Islamist militia in Tripoli said on Wednesday that it had arrested Mr. Abedi’ 20-year-old brother, Hashem, at the family’ home in the Libyan capital on Tuesday, and said that he was a member of the Islamic State who was planning an attack in Tripoli.

“e have been following him for at least a month and a half now,”aid Ahmed Omran, a spokesman for the militia, known as the Special Deterrence Force.

Later, Mr. Omran said the group was also holding the father, Ramadan Abedi, who is also known as Abu Ismail.

The Special Deterrence Force, or Rada, is one of the most powerful militant groups in the often lawless capital. Its leaders are staunch Islamists and it operates a detention facility where many people suspected of being Islamic State fighters have been held.

Mr. Omran said that Hashem Abedi had told the militia that he was “ept in the loop about the attack”n Manchester by his brother, and that the group had said in a Facebook post  that Hashem was involved in the planning of the bombing, although it offered no proof.

The militia also said that Hashem traveled to Libya from Britain on April 16, and that he had been in daily phone contact with his older brother since then.

8 in Custody After Latest Arrests

The Greater Manchester Police said on Wednesday night that two more people, a man and a woman, had been arrested in connection with the investigation. The man was taken into custody in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, in central England, according to the police. The woman was arrested during raids in the Blackley area of Manchester, north of the city center. The police provided no further details.

Early on Thursday morning, the police announced  that they had arrested another man in the Withingon area, in the south of Manchester, adding that the woman arrested in Blackley had been released without charge.

Eight men are now in custody in connection with the attack, the police said on Thursday.

‘ Don’ Believe That It Was Him’

Before his arrest by the Special Deterrence Force in Libya, the bomber’ father said in a phone interview that his son Salman could not have carried out the attack on the Manchester Arena.

“ don’ believe that it was him,”aid the father, Ramadan Abedi. “is ideas and his ideology were not like that. He was born and raised in Britain. He’ a British citizen and he does not hold such ideologies.”

Salman Abedi, born in Manchester in 1994, had recently visited his parents, who had moved back to Libya after living for decades in Britain. The father, speaking from Tripoli, said he believed that his son was on his way to make a religious pilgrimage at the time of the attack.

4 More Victims Identified

Four more victims of the Manchester Arena attack have been identified.

Eilidh MacLeod, 14, of the Isle of Barra, in Scotland. “ur family is devastated and words cannot express how we feel at losing our darling Eilidh,”he family said in a statement. “ilidh was vivacious and full of fun. She loved all music whether it was listening to Ariana or playing the bagpipes with her pipe band.”

Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19, of South Shields, in northeast England: “n the night our daughter Chloe died and our son Liam died, their wings were ready but our hearts were not,”the families said in a statement posted on Facebook . “hey were perfect in every way for each other.”

Elaine McIver, a Cheshire police officer: “laine just loved life, and had a major love of music. Despite what has happened to her, she would want us all to carry on regardless and not be frightened by fear tactics, instead she regularly urged us all to rise up against it.”

Manchester Bomber Was Part of a ‘etwork’

Investigators have been focused on determining who may have helped the bomber, Mr. Abedi, plan and execute the attack at the Manchester Arena after an Ariana Grande concert.

“t seems likely —ossible —hat he wasn’ doing this on his own,”ritain’ home secretary, Amber Rudd , said on Wednesday.

Chief Constable Ian Hopkins of the Greater Manchester Police said at a news conference on Wednesday, “his is a network that we are investigating.”

He did not specify whom the police were looking for, or if investigators were searching for a bomb maker.

“here’ an extensive investigation going on, and activity taking place across Greater Manchester as we speak,”e said.

Four men were arrested on Wednesday —hree in Manchester and one in Wigan, a town to the northwest —s the number of people in custody, including Mr. Abedi’ older brother, continued to rise. What role, if any, they played in the attack is unclear.

Evidence photographed and collected  at the crime scene suggests an improvised device made with forethought and care.

The BBC , citing unidentified intelligence sources, reported on Wednesday that officials believed Mr. Abedi had been a “ule,”arrying a bomb made by someone else.

Officials are still trying to find the “actory”here the bomb was made and to discern whether Mr. Abedi received help assembling the device, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the secrecy surrounding the investigation.

Officials are also looking into reports that people who knew Mr. Abedi —ncluding an imam at his mosque —ontacted the authorities as much as two years ago with concerns that he had become radicalized.

Salman Abedi’ Possible Radicalization

Friends and neighbors of Salman Abedi have said he expressed extremist views, and a security official has said he traveled to Syria, the stronghold of the Islamic State.

In 2015, according to a neighbor of the Abedi family who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, the imam at the mosque the family attended delivered a sermon condemning terrorism and murder carried out in the name of a political cause. The sermon by the imam, Mohammed Saeed, prompted a heated discussion among congregants, some of whom signed a petition taking issue with it, according to the neighbor.

“e was angry,”he neighbor said of Mr. Abedi. “e scared some people.”

A friend of Mr. Abedi, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety, said that the assailant, along with other young men of Libyan descent in Manchester, had been deeply angered by the gang killing last year of a friend, Abdul Wahab Hafidah .

It was around this time, according to people who knew the family, that Mr. Abedi traveled to Libya to see his parents. He also traveled to Syria, according to the French interior minister, Géard Collomb.

Mr. Collomb said that Mr. Abedi had “roven”ies to the Islamic State, but he did not give details. It was not clear whether Mr. Abedi’ visits to Libya and Syria were part of the same trip.

During Mr. Abedi’ visit to Libya, his parents became worried about his radicalization, and even seized his British passport, according to the friend in Manchester.

Mr. Abedi’ father denied this. He said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that his son was not an extremist and was in possession of the passport because he was traveling back to Manchester before going to Saudi Arabia for a religious pilgrimage.

MANCHESTER, England —he police accelerated their hunt Wednesday for co-plotters of the Manchester concert bombing, making at least a half-dozen arrests in Britain, searching for a possible clandestine bomb factory and extending the investigation to Libya, where two of the bomber’ relatives were detained.

The developments indicated that the bomber, Salman Abedi, 22, was part of a wider and more sophisticated plot than was initially thought and that finding the bomb’ origins had now become a priority in a country still reeling from the terrorist attack, the worst in Britain in more than a decade.

New details about the bomb , based on forensic photographs from the blast site, showed it may have been hidden in a blue backpack, had been made with cunning care to inflict horrific shrapnel damage, and had even been equipped with a backup detonation system.

A portrait of Mr. Abedi also came into focus, showing him to be a Manchester United fan, a college dropout and an occasional marijuana smoker who had visited his family in Libya last month, returned to Manchester as recently as last week, and may have been radicalized two years ago.

These details of his life emerged as the police sought what they called his “etwork”—he first official confirmation that investigators believed Mr. Abedi had help.

“t seems likely —ossible —hat he wasn’ doing this on his own,”aid Britain’ home secretary, Amber Rudd . Speaking to the BBC , she also said the bomb “as more sophisticated than some of the attacks we’e seen before.”

Chief Constable Ian Hopkins of the Greater Manchester Police said, “here’ an extensive investigation going on, and activity taking place across Greater Manchester.”

Mr. Abedi detonated the bomb  Monday night as fans were leaving a pop concert by the American singer Ariana Grande  at Manchester Arena. The explosion killed 22 people , including a police officer and an 8-year-old girl. The bomber’ remains were found at the scene, and the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.

At least 64 people were wounded, a third of them critically. Many victims were teenagers and young girls, with parents in tow, who idolized Ms. Grande.

She officially canceled all concerts on her “angerous Woman”uropean tour through June 5 and asked fans to support “ll those families affected by this cowardice and senseless act of violence.”

The race to find co-conspirators and the place where the bomb had been made appeared to be the main reasons behind the British government ’ decision on Tuesday to raise the terrorist threat warning  to critical, its highest level since 2007, over fears that more bombs could be detonated in crowded places.

The Greater Manchester P olice said  early Thursday  that eight men were in custody in connection with the investigation —ncluding Mr. Abedi’ older brother. A woman was also detained, but she was released without charges, the police said.

In Libya, Mr. Abedi’ father was arrested by a militia, the Special Deterrence Forces, which said it also had detained Mr. Abedi’ younger brother, Hashem Abedi, 20.

In a Facebook post , the militia said that Hashem Abedi had been a member of the Islamic State, was tied to the Manchester plot and was en route to withdrawing 4,500 Libyan dinars (about $560 on the black market) sent by the bomber when he was arrested on Tuesday night by the militia.

The militia said that Hashem Abedi had traveled from Britain to Libya on April 16, that he had been planning an attack in Tripoli and that he had been in daily contact by phone with his older brother.

The militia’ claims about the younger brother could not be immediately verified. The militia is affiliated with the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord, one of three administrations vying for control of Libya, but it has been accused by human rights groups of abusing prisoners.

Besides the younger brother, the authorities were pursuing many leads. The BBC reported that officials believed Salman Abedi may have been a “ule,”arrying a bomb made by someone else. The officials also said they were looking into Mr. Abedi’ relationship with Raphael Hostey , a British recruiter for the Islamic State believed to have been killed in a drone strike in Syria  last year.

In Washington, a senior American official said Mr. Abedi had links to a radical preacher in Libya identified as Abdul Baset Ghwela, whose son had joined the Islamic State in Libya and had died fighting in Benghazi. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose intelligence information, said Mr. Abedi had not left Libya until May 17.

In addition, officials were looking into reports that people who knew Mr. Abedi —ncluding an imam at his mosque —ad contacted the authorities as early as 2015 with concerns that he may have been recruited by extremists.

The heightened warning of additional, possibly imminent attacks was visible nationwide. The government suspended public tours of Parliament and canceled the guard-changing ceremony at Buckingham Palace, a tourist favorite. Soldiers patrolled locations including Downing Street, where the home and office of the prime minister are, and foreign embassies.

Manchester, a city of half a million and the hub of Britain’ second-largest metropolitan region, is home to a sizable community of people of Libyan descent. Many fled the regime of the longtime dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in the 1980s. The violent overthrow of Colonel Qaddafi  in 2011 during the tumult of the Arab Spring created a power vacuum, and the Islamic State and other extremist groups have since gained support.

Many Libyan expatriates are clustered in Manchester, creating one of the largest Libyan communities outside Libya, according to Nazir Afzal, who until 2015 was the chief prosecutor for northwest England, based in the city.

Among them was the Abedi family, which moved to Britain in 1993. Salman Abedi was born there a year later.

Reached by phone in Libya on Wednesday, Ramadan Abedi, his father, expressed shock and denied that his son was the bomber.

“ don’ believe that it was him,”e said. “is ideas and his ideology were not like that.”

Mr. Abedi confirmed that his son had been distressed by the murder of a friend, Abdul Wahab Hafidah , in May 2016 at the hands of suspected gang members. But he said it did not drive him toward radicalism.

The father’ account was contradicted by several people who knew the family, including one quoted by the BBC who said Salman Abedi had expressed approval of suicide bombers a few years ago, leading neighbors to call an antiterrorism hotline.

The French interior minister, Géard Collomb, said on Wednesday that Mr. Abedi had “ost likely”one to Syria and that he had “roven”inks to the Islamic State.

Mr. Abedi’ parents, who moved back to Libya after Colonel Qaddafi’ downfall, had become worried about their son’ radicalization, and they had even seized his British passport, according to a friend in Manchester who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety.

Mr. Abedi had told his parents that he wanted to visit the holy city of Mecca, so they returned his passport. But instead he returned home, the friend said.

The father denied that account. “e was a man and I trust the man that he was,”e said. A short while later, the father was arrested in Tripoli, according to the same Islamist militia that announced the younger brother’ arrest.

A number of Libyans from Manchester have waged jihad abroad, according to Raffaello Pantucci, a terrorism expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The Qaeda-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group had a contingent in Manchester, Mr. Pantucci said. And in 2010 and 2011, as the anti-Qaddafi uprising in Libya intensified, a number of Libyan-Britons left Manchester for Libya as foreign fighters, he said. More recently, he said, a cluster left for Syria.

In Fallowfield, a neighborhood south of the Manchester city center, residents recalled Mr. Abedi as quiet, respectful and passionate about soccer, often wearing a T-shirt with a Manchester United emblem.

Officials at the Manchester Islamic Center, also known as Didsbury Mosque , where the Abedi family worshiped, have condemned the attack, but declined to talk about the family.

“he horrific atrocity that occurred in Manchester on Monday night has shocked us all,” mosque trustee, Fawzi Haffar, told reporters.

In 2015, according to a neighbor who spoke on the condition of anonymity over concerns about safety, an imam at the mosque, Mohammed Saeed, delivered a sermon condemning terrorism for political causes. The sermon prompted a heated discussion among congregants and some, including Mr. Abedi, objected to it.

“e was angry,”he neighbor said. “e scared some people.”

Aleppo After the Fall

One morning in mid-December, a group of soldiers banged on the door of a house in eastern Aleppo. A male voice responded from inside: “ho are you?” soldier answered: “e’e the Syrian Arab Army. It’ O.K., you can come out. They’e all gone.”

The door opened. A middle-aged man appeared. He had a gaunt, distinguished face, but his clothes were threadbare and his teeth looked brown and rotted. At the soldiers’ncouragement, he stepped hesitantly forward into the street. He explained to them, a little apologetically, that he had not crossed his threshold in four and a half years.

The man gazed around for a moment as if baffled, his eyes filling with tears. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad had just recaptured the city after years of bombing and urban warfare that had made Aleppo a global byword for savagery. This frail-looking man had survived at the war’ geographic center entirely alone, an urban Robinson Crusoe, living on stocks of dry food and whatever he could grow in his small inner courtyard. Now, as he stumbled through an alley full of twisted metal and rubble, he saw for the first time that the front lines, marked by a wall of sandbags, were barely 20 yards from his house.

Three months later, in March, he sat with me under the tall, spindly orange tree in his courtyard and described how he barricaded himself in when the fighting started. He goes by the name Abu Sami, and he has the mild, patient manners of a scholar; he taught at Aleppo University before the war. In the early days of the rebel takeover, he said, his nephews used to drop by with fresh bread and meat. But starting in 2013, the shelling grew worse, and he would go six months or more without seeing another human face. There was no water, no electric light; he gathered rainwater in buckets and boiled it and used a small solar panel to charge his phone. He made vinegar from grapes he grew in the courtyard. He treated his illnesses with aloe and other herbs he grew in pots. Once, when a rotten tooth became too painful, he yanked it out with pliers. He cowered by his bed when bombs shook the house to its foundation.

Most of all, he sustained himself by reading. He carried out a stack of books from his bedroom to show me: treatises by Sigmund Freud, novels by Henry Miller, histories of science and psychology and religion and mythology and cooking, a book on radical theater by the American drama critic Robert Brustein. Some were in Russian, a language he learned as a young man. “ read these things so I wouldn’ have to think about politics or current events,”e said. He read plays —hakespeare and Molièe were favorites —nd in his solitude, he found that he was able to see the entire drama acted out in his mind, as if it were onstage.

He led me upstairs to see his dusty study, where the walls and ceiling were shredded with dozens of small shrapnel holes that let in fingers of sunlight. He picked up a bomb fragment, rolled it in his palm and laughed. He pointed to the house next door, where his neighbor, a quiet man who kept pigeons on the roof, had lived until a group of rebels arrived, shouting, and dragged him from the door. They brought back his corpse half an hour later.

I asked Abu Sami why he never left. He gave the same answer that so many others gave me: because it was his house. And because day after day, year after year, he kept thinking, Surely this war is about to end.

In the eastern Aleppo streets beyond Abu Sami’ house, little has changed since the December morning when he rediscovered his ruined city. A narrow alley leads to an open area where a “ell cannon”till sits, the homemade howitzer used by rebels to fire on government-controlled western Aleppo. Beyond it, there are buildings with pancaked roofs, evidence of Russian and Syrian bombs. There are piles of rubble so high that entire streets remain impassable. Throughout the former rebel zone that once proudly called itself “ree Aleppo,”here are hospitals and schools and houses —t goes on for miles —hat have been reduced to uneven heaps of stone and broken concrete, where the faint smell of buried corpses still lingers.

In the United States, the drawn-out siege of Aleppo —here the Syrian regime and its Russian allies repeatedly bombed hospitals and civilian areas —as widely deplored as a war crime comparable to the worst massacres of the Bosnian war during the 1990s. The refusal to intervene, some said, was a defining moral failure of the Obama administration. On the other side, regime supporters saw only the rebels’trocities and their manipulation of civilians for propaganda. The “all”f Aleppo, they said, was really the “iberation”f a city from terrorist rule, and a sign that Assad had all but won the civil war.

Both portraits are false and self-serving. The Syrian tragedy started in a moment of deceptive simplicity, when the peaceful protesters of the 2011 Arab Spring seemed destined to inherit the future. Chants for freedom turned quickly to insurrection, bullets and war. But it took some time for outsiders to recognize how different Syria was, how its internal schisms —ike tightly coiled springs —ould provoke the fears and ambitions of all its neighbors. The Saudis and Turks wanted to replace Assad with a reliable Sunni client, while Iran and Hezbollah held fast to their one foothold in the Arab world. Russia, which intervened decisively in 2015, had its own motives: flouting American designs and protecting a reliable autocrat. The United States, having expected Assad to fall on his own, dithered over support for the rebels.

Aleppo became the rebels’ast major urban redoubt. Its fall reconfigured the Syrian battleground: The Saudis and Turks resigned themselves to Assad’ rule, and their rivals exulted in a victory that seemed to justify years of blood and treasure. The Assad regime happily stepped out of the limelight as the world’ attention turned back to capturing Raqqa, the ISIS capital in Syria’ northeast.

One small measure of the regime’ confidence was a renewed willingness to let Western journalists —ncluding me —ravel the country. I was under the usual police-state surveillance, with a minder from the Information Ministry accompanying me during my travels outside Damascus. But scarcely any Americans had been to Aleppo since the regime’ victory in December. The city had become a symbol of sorts, a sprawling commercial hub where every faction seemed to have left its mark. I had been trying to get back there for years; it was a place I loved when I covered the region from Beirut. I wanted to wind back the clock and make sense of how a city that seemed so averse to politics —f any kind —ad been torn apart.

Even Syrians have trouble answering that question. In March, I met a lawyer named Anas Joudeh, who took part in some of the 2011 protests. Joudeh no longer considers himself a member of the opposition. I asked him why. “o one is 100 percent with the regime, but mostly these people are unified by their resistance to the opposition,”oudeh told me. “hey know what they don’ want, not what they want.”n December, he said, “yrians abroad who believe in the revolution would call me and say, ‘e lost Aleppo.’nd I would say, ‘hat do you mean?’t was only a Turkish card guarded by jihadis.”or these exiled Syrians, he said, the specter of Assad’ crimes looms so large that they cannot see anything else. They refuse to acknowledge the realities of a rebellion that is corrupt, brutal and compromised by foreign sponsors. This is true. Eastern Aleppo may not have been Raqqa, where ISIS advertised its rigid Islamist dystopia and its mass beheadings. But as a symbol of Syria’ future, it was almost as bad: a chaotic wasteland full of feuding militias —ome of them radical Islamists —ho hoarded food and weapons while the people starved.

As for the regime’ victory there, it probably would not have taken place if Turkey had not withdrawn some of its rebel proxies to focus on fighting the Kurds. Aleppo may have helped the regime’ morale, but the war is likely to grind on for years, sustained and manipulated by outside powers. Assad needs them: His army has been decimated by war and desertions. That may help explain his use of chemical weapons in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in early April, which prompted the Trump administration’ slap-on-the-wrist missile strike. With his manpower running out, Assad cares more about reinforcing his rule —t any cost —han rehabilitating his reputation in the West, which might have provided loans to help rebuild his shattered country.

All the same, Aleppo was a turning point, and in some ways an emblem of the wider war. Its fall appears to have persuaded many ordinary Syrians that the regime, for all its appalling cruelty and corruption, is their best shot at something close to normality. This is almost certainly true for the Trump administration too. President Trump may call Assad an “nimal”nd hint at more airstrikes, but he cannot unseat him, because he knows that the alternative is not the kinder, gentler place once dreamed of by opposition activists. It is anarchy, where the warlords rule not from the presidential palace but from every town and every street.

First they stole everything, then they burned everything,”reddy Marrache told me as I stumbled along in the darkness behind him. Above us were vaulted medieval stone roofs, interrupted here and there by huge shell holes. “his was the spice market —t’ totally gone. The front line was just here.”nderfoot was a slurry of ash and garbage. Marrache, a 48-year-old businessman with a pale, shaved head and an air of quiet alertness, made frequent visits as a child to Aleppo’ Old City. The souqs were its crown jewel, a cloacal maze of market stalls packed with spices, fabrics, silks, leather, soaps, gold, meat, fruit, carpets, toilet seats —lmost anything. It went on for more than eight miles, one of the largest covered markets in the world. Aleppans used to say that a blind man could find his way through them by following the smells of the merchandise. Then, in 2012, the rebels came, and the souqs became the perfect refuge for urban guerrillas.

Marrache and his sister, Marie-Michelle, had offered to show me the remains of the Khan al Nahassine, a grand old house attached to the souqs that was built in 1539 and has been owned by their family since the 1800s. I first saw it a decade earlier, when their mother, Jenny Poche Marrache, walked me through it. She was then in her 60s, and she had a sour elegance that seemed to match the place. I remember her complaining about Islamists as she chain-smoked and concluding acidly in French, “oon I’l be dead, and it won’ matter.”he waited patiently as I stared at the parade of antiquities on every wall: paintings, sculptures, documents, old musical instruments, photographs. That house was a shrine to the old Levantine world of which Aleppo —ith its polyglot traders, its mix of Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam —ad been the center. Jenny died in 2015, before she could see the extent of the damage to the house.

Everything was gone. Even the copper wiring had been stripped out. The walls were still there, but on the far side some rooms had collapsed into the courtyard after heavy shelling. “ou remember the painting that was here?”reddy asked. I did. It was of a woman in Renaissance dress, the wife of the first Venetian consul in Aleppo. (Aleppo still has honorary consulships for many European countries.) The painting was memorable because it was painted in the same room where it hung; you could recognize the other objects and the shape of the wall. Freddy explained that the painting had turned up in Turkey, like much of what the rebels had stolen across Aleppo. An Istanbul antiques dealer told them that he would sell it back to them for $20,000. When they protested that it was stolen, Freddy told me, the dealer said dismissively, “ get things from Syria every day.”

Back in the souqs, I kept trying to superimpose my memories of the place. We passed near the silk merchants’rea, now blackened and silent. Before 2011, I used to stop there and visit a flamboyant young trader with a round, cherubic face. He would give me tea and drape me with scarves. His little stall was covered with pictures of gay icons like Judy Garland, a reference that his Syrian partners seemed not to get (or perhaps they just didn’ care). I still have his business card, with a picture of Oscar Wilde and the quote: “ can resist everything except temptation.”leppo in those days was a magnet for footloose journalists and adventure tourists. We would spend hours getting lost in the souqs and then stop for drinks in the dimly lit bar at the Hotel Baron, gazing at its old unpaid bar tab left by T.E. Lawrence, our heads swimming with nostalgia for an era we knew only from books.

Now parts of the city were literally unrecognizable. In al-Hatab Square, once one of the prettier spots in the Old City, I found only a giant, uneven mound of rubble and earth that rose 15 feet above the street, with grass growing in it. I almost stepped on an unexploded Turkish gas bomb surrounded by yellow spring flowers. On the square’ edges, half the buildings were destroyed. It was hard to believe this was once an orderly urban setting, lined with restaurants and hotels. The last time I was in Aleppo, in late 2010, I stayed at a beautiful old boutique hotel near the square, the Beit Wakil. I remember the owner taking me down into a dark, earthen-walled subbasement to show me a network of tunnels built centuries earlier. You could travel all the way to the citadel —he great medieval palace that towers over the Old City —ithout going aboveground, he said. They were built during the 17th century, when intermittent wars often made streets too treacherous to walk. “erhaps we will need them again,”e said.

What destroyed Aleppo? It was not the sectarianism that is often held up as a key to the Syrian war. It was not just “errorism,”he word used by regime apologists to fend off any share of blame. Those things played a role, but the core of the conflict in Aleppo, as in much of Syria, was a divide between urban wealth and rural poverty. It is not new. Travelers in the Ottoman era used to describe the shocking gulf between Aleppo’ opulence and the countryside surrounding it, where peasants lived in almost Stone Age conditions. Later, this divide mapped onto the city itself, as eastern Aleppo spread and filled with poor migrants. Deeply religious and mostly illiterate, smoldering with class resentment, they became the foot soldiers of a violent insurgency led by the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1970s. That rebellion burned for years and culminated in the Syrian regime’ notorious massacre of 10,000 to 30,000 people in the city of Hama in 1982. Hundreds of people were killed in Aleppo, too, and a siege atmosphere marked the entire city. The Syrian novelist Khaled Khalifa, who grew up in Aleppo during those years and wrote a novel about it, told me in 2008 that the city’ cosmopolitan traditions had helped protect it. But he added: “ll this has harmed Syrian society so much. If what happened in the 1980s were to happen again, I think the Islamists would win.”

One tragedy of Aleppo is that this rift between rich and poor was slowly mending in the years just before the 2011 uprisings. An economic renaissance was underway, fueled by thousands of small factories on the city’ outskirts. The workers were mostly from eastern Aleppo, and the owners from the west. A trade deal with Turkey, whose border is just 30 miles to the north, brought new business and tourists and optimism. I remember sitting at cafe table with two Turkish traders just outside the citadel in late 2009. Tourists thronged all around us, and the two men talked excitedly about how new joint ventures were melting the animosity between their country and Syria. “rdogan and Assad, they are like real friends,”ne of them said, referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.

This kind of optimism was one reason the revolution took so long to reach Aleppo. All through 2011, as the rest of Syria erupted in protest, its largest city was quiet. But by 2012, in the villages just beyond the city’ edges, weaponry was flowing in from across the Turkish border and battalions were being formed. “he countryside was boiling,” was told by Adnan Hadad, an opposition activist who was there at the time and belonged to the Revolutionary Military Council in Aleppo, a group led by Syrian military officers who defected. The council was eager for more European and American recognition and sensitive to Western calls for the preservation of most of Syria’ state institutions. But local rural people tended to side with a more Islamist and less patient group called Liwa al-Tawheed. Tawheed’ members “onsidered themselves more authentic”nd had begun getting their own funding from Persian Gulf donors, Hadad told me. In the spring of 2012, Tawheed’ members began pushing for a military takeover of Aleppo, accusing the council of excessive caution and even secret deals with the regime. The council resisted, saying they should move only when it was clear that the city’ people wanted them to. In July, Tawheed took matters into its own hands. Armed insurgents flooded eastern and southwestern parts of the city, taking over civilian houses as well as police stations in the name of the revolution. Hadad considered the move a “atal mistake,”e told me, and resigned from the military council.

By then, eastern Aleppo had become a rebel stronghold. In early 2013, elections for provincial councils took place, giving the rebels a civilian veneer. But the councils, initially funded by the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, were soon under pressure from the Nusra Front, the Syrian Qaeda affiliate, and other hard-line groups. Later, ISIS forces captured parts of the city and forced residents to live by their rigid code. In theory, Aleppo was an embattled showplace for the Syrian revolution’ aspirations. In fact, most civilians were dependent on a patchwork of armed rebel factions for food and protection. The constant pressure of war left almost no room for a real economy, and many of the city’ factories had been repurposed by the rebels as military bases.

Now Aleppo’ great economic engine lies in ruins. One afternoon, a 45-year-old factory owner named Ghassan Nasi took me to the industrial area just west of Aleppo called Layramoon. The sounds of the city dissipated as we drove west, and when the car stopped, there was an eerie silence. An entire district that once hummed with 1,000 small factories was now abandoned, most of its buildings shattered and burned. “t is a 100 percent loss here,”asi said. We walked down a dusty street to his factory, a textile and dyeing house that employed 130 people who worked 24 hours a day in three shifts. The door still had its metal filigree gate and marble steps. “his is where workers stamped in and out,”e said.

Inside, the huge factory floor was burned black and strewn with rubble. The rebels had used it to make weapons, he said. His old office had been used to house prisoners. Nasi told me quietly that he collapsed to his knees upon seeing it again last summer. “ lost $10 million in machinery, $4 million in land,”e said. “ven if we rebuild, the machinery is gone, and with the sanctions, we cannot buy new machinery.”n top of that, there is inflation: The American dollar was worth 47 Syrian pounds before the crisis, and now it trades unofficially at about 520. And Turkey —here much of the Aleppo factories’achinery was transported and sold, often with the collusion of Syrian owners who wanted to avoid losing everything —ow sells similar textiles for less. Reviving Syrian industry, and the social glue it might once have provided, is next to impossible.

I asked Nasi what had become of his workers. He said about 70 percent of them joined the rebels. He didn’ seem bitter or surprised about this. Some lived nearby, so when the area was divided, they had little choice. As for the others, they were poor and ill educated and religious, and the rebels promised them a lot. “he average salary for workers was about a hundred dollars a week,”e said. “he rebels paid more.”

For many Aleppans, caught up in a conflict they had tried to avoid, the only rule was survival. On a warm spring morning in 2013, a 22-year-old man named Yasser lay bleeding in the middle of a street in eastern Aleppo. Moments earlier, he had carried his mother, mortally wounded by a sniper, into his grandparents’ar. As he watched the car pull away, three bullets struck his legs and left arm. He collapsed into the street and could not move. Shots rang out over his head: regime soldiers trading fire with rebels on either side of him. The soldiers heard Yasser calling for help and told him to come toward them. “ can’ move,”e shouted. Then a rebel spoke from a nearby building, promising to help. When he answered, a regime soldier called out, “ho are you talking to?”he rebels quickly warned him not to answer or they would kill him.

“ was very scared of both sides,”asser told me later. “f I went to one side, the other would kill me.”e lay there, his limbs going numb, too frightened to move or speak for more than four hours.

I met Yasser in March in Sha’r, the most devastated neighborhood in eastern Aleppo. He was short and solidly built, with a snub nose and a gruff manner. He was selling tomatoes and cucumbers from a stand, on a block where many buildings were in ruins. Across the street was a fruit stand, and next to it, a loud generator, set up by the government to supply electricity. Surprising numbers of people walked the streets. This place had been almost completely empty a few weeks earlier, but now that Russian mine-clearing teams had been through and the rubble was mostly pushed aside, Sha’r’ residents were returning to their homes. (More than 100,000 went back to eastern Aleppo between January and March, according to the International Organization for Migration.) Yasser said he was one of the first people to come back, right after what he —ike everyone else I met —alled the liberation. It was a gesture of defiance, aimed at the rebels. “hat we lost, we will get it back,”e said. He wore military fatigues, and he told me he re-enlisted in the military after he got out of the hospital in 2013. “y blood type is O-Assad,”e said.

Later, Yasser showed me the place where he was wounded. It was the first time he’ been back since it happened, and the block had changed, like most of eastern Aleppo. “here was a checkpoint here, there were sandbags there,”e said. He pointed out the first-floor window where an old man had talked to him through curtains as he lay on the street. He showed me the building where he thought the sniper had been hiding, about 100 yards away. He explained how his ordeal had ended: An airstrike hit the building, and the sniper vanished. A man on a motorbike rescued Yasser, carrying him to a house, where someone cleaned his wounds. Later, he was taken to a hospital, where a doctor told him that his mother was dead. The doctor put a needle in his arm and told him to count to three, and he blacked out.

I found Yasser’ story credible, and his uncle later backed it up. But as I stood on the street with him, I found myself wondering: Did he really know who shot him? Bullets were coming from each side. As he lay there bleeding, whom was he more frightened of —he rebels or the regime? Yasser clearly knew how his government is portrayed in the West and seemed defensive about it. He told me a rebel group tried to blame the regime for his mother’ death. Later, he said, the same group admitted its guilt and offered blood money, which the family refused to take. This seemed less plausible. He walked me down the street to his uncle’ house, where he said we would hear another story about what the rebels had done.

Yasser’ uncle was a big, heavyset man with a jowly face and a look of weary resignation in his eyes. He welcomed us into his tiny apartment, where he offered me a stool and sat down on his old brass bed. He sighed and apologized for being unable to offer us tea. Then he showed us his scarred arm and told us the story of how his family was devastated in January 2013. He was driving his pregnant daughter to the hospital when machine-gun fire riddled the car, killing his wife instantly and wounding everyone else. He told me rebels from the Free Syrian Army pulled them from the car and rushed them to a nearby hospital. I asked who fired on them. “ don’ know,”e said.

There was a silence. Until that moment, I had not heard anyone miss an opportunity to blame the rebels. With my government minder looking on, Yasser began asking where the gunfire had come from. Wasn’ it from a tall building nearby? Weren’ the rebels in that building? The uncle shrugged. “ don’ know,”e said again. I had the impression that he was profoundly depressed and past caring about what he was supposed to say. Yasser kept pressing. Eventually, the uncle caved in and said, Sure, it was probably the rebels. “y wife died a martyr,”e said. “or the F.S.A., I cannot say, because they helped me and my wife. I cannot say how they are with other people.”nd then quietly, he began to cry.

There is a billboard hanging over one of Aleppo’ main intersections that shows a soldier wearing a helmet, with his entire face shrouded in shadow. Beneath it are the words “leppo in Our Eyes.”he image stuck with me. Which Aleppo? Whose eyes? In Arabic, the expression conveys affection, but the words also seemed to hint at the city’ fragmented loyalties, its atmosphere of enduring suspicion. It wasn’ just regime allegiance that made people like Yasser tailor their stories. He refused to be photographed, and when I asked why, he hinted that the rebels might still be able to find and kill him, even after the regime’ triumph. Another man described receiving a visit at his home in government-controlled Aleppo from two ISIS members, who calmly blackmailed him and went on their way, unhurried. The city had changed hands so many times that no one could be fully confident whose eyes would be watching them.

On my second day in the city, I went to see the Aleppo Eye Hospital, a sprawling compound that the rebels had used as a military headquarters. As we walked through the burned and shattered building, my government minder and the soldiers guarding the place kept picking up markers of the rebels’slamist leanings. They weren’ hard to find. A fire-blackened car out front still had the Qaeda logo on its hood. Inside, the rebels had put up paper signs to show how they used the rooms: a room where Shariah rulings were handed out by a religious sheikh, a document about Islamic punishments. There was a prison too, and I later met a woman who seems to have been kept there. She had been captured in a rural village, and the rebels killed her husband and then moved her from place to place, intending to trade her for their own prisoners. There were female jailers who beat and cursed her and called her an infidel. She told me she was given a bottle of water to wash herself with once every 10 to 15 days. During the final battle for Aleppo, she often heard the sounds of bombs and mortars exploding nearby, and her jailers would taunt her, saying Assad’ bombs will kill you.

As I walked through those ruins, it was clear enough that the rebels who ruled eastern Aleppo had done some awful things there. Yet the whole hospital tour was designed, at least in part, to mitigate or obscure a very uncomfortable fact. The Assad regime repeatedly and deliberately bombed hospitals in the rebel zone, even when there was no reason to suspect that fighters were based there. No one would discuss this with me during my time in Aleppo, even when I did not have the minder with me. Instead, I had to speak to people who fled eastern Aleppo under the terms of the deal to evacuate the city in December, when the regime recaptured it. They were living in Idlib province, to the southwest, which is held by rebels, and I spoke to them by Skype. One was a young man who worked as a nurse at the Omar bin Abdul Aziz Hospital throughout 2016. He told me that the hospital was rendered inoperable 15 times by regime airstrikes. Each time, engineers and doctors would rehabilitate it, only to see it damaged again. When the regime soldiers got too close, they moved to another hospital, called Al Quds. It was so crowded that they sometimes tended the wounded in the street outside.

Stories like this have been amply documented and held up as evidence that the Assad regime is guilty of war crimes on a wide scale. A nongovernmental organization in Europe has been working for years to gather documents that would tie the Syrian leadership to these crimes in a Nuremberg-style trial. That prospect is remote, but there are signs that Assad, too, may be worried about whose eyes are watching him. This month, the State Department released satellite photographs suggesting that the regime is burning the bodies of executed prisoners in a crematory at the Sednaya prison complex, north of Damascus, in an alleged effort to hide evidence. The Syrian regime called these charges a “ew Hollywood plot.”

One afternoon, I was sitting in an Aleppo cafe with a 26-year-old man who had just got out of the army after six years. He served all over the country and had shrapnel wounds on his legs and back. His cellphone rang, and I watched his eyes widen as he absorbed what was obviously bad news. When he got off the phone, he told me that six friends from his old unit had just been killed in Jobar, a suburb of Damascus. The rebels had launched a complex attack using tunnels and multiple suicide bombers. All in all, about 30 regime soldiers had been killed. That attack was the start of a rebel offensive that reached the edge of Damascus’ Old City, keeping residents awake much of the night with deafening blasts. The rebels mounted simultaneous assaults to the north, forcing the roads to close for days. I had my own minor brush with the rebel campaign. As I was driving from Aleppo to the Syrian coast, rebels opened fire on the road to our right as we passed near the city of Homs. A soldier yelled at us to move fast, and our driver gunned the engine —e must have hit 100 miles an hour on a tiny two-way road —nd told us to duck our heads. The rebels were just a hundred yards away. I heard their shellfire thumping in the distance almost everywhere I went.

It is impossible to live in government-controlled Syria without noticing that there are almost no young men on the street. They are in the army, or they are dead. Veterans must carry their military papers with them or risk on-the-spot re-enlistment. At one checkpoint, government soldiers tried to grab the young Spanish photographer I was working with, who is easily mistaken for a Syrian; they wanted to recruit him. In Latakia, a beach town in the regime’ northwestern heartland, I met a 53-year-old businessman named Munzer Nasser, who commands a militia composed almost entirely of older men; there are no young men left in his village. One of its members, he told me, is a 65-year-old whose three sons have all been killed in the war. Behind the Assad regime’ atrocities lies a fear of demographic exhaustion. Its rebel opponents have no such worries: They can draw on a vast well of Islamist sympathizers across the Arab world.

These facts translate into a genuine gratitude —n regime-controlled areas —oward Russia, whose military intervention in late 2015 may have forestalled a total collapse. Many Syrians say they feel reassured by the sight of Russian soldiers, because they (unlike the army and its allied militias) are not likely to loot or steal. Some of my contacts in regime-controlled areas are even learning Russian. In Latakia, some people told me that their city might have been destroyed if not for the Russians. The city has long been one of Syria’ safe zones, well defended by the army and its militias; there are tent cities full of people who have fled other parts of the country, including thousands from Aleppo. But in the summer of 2015, the rebels were closing in on the Latakia city limits, and mortars were falling downtown. If the rebels had captured the area —here Alawites are the majority — result would almost certainly have been sectarian mass murder. Many people in the region would have blamed the United States, which armed some of the rebels operating in the area. In this sense, the Russian intervention was a lucky thing for the Obama administration too. Andrew Exum, who worked in the Pentagon at the time, told me that the military drew up contingency plans for a rapid collapse of the regime. The planning sessions were talked about as “atastrophic success.”

Yet Assad’ popularity is due not only to his role as the guarantor of a secular order. He has also cannily positioned himself as a unique guardian against his own regime. Just before I arrived in Aleppo in March, a high-ranking Republican Guard commander in the city issued a public order declaring a crackdown on “cts of looting, robbery and assaults on public property and on the freedoms of citizens and their private property.”he order was a belated recognition of what had been going on for months: an orgy of looting by the various paramilitary groups that work alongside the Syrian Army, and even by elements of the army itself.

I heard complaints about this everywhere I went. Looting has become so common that it has generated a new word: ta’eesh, to steal furniture. One reporter for the regime-friendly TV channel Al Mayadeen said in a November interview that “his systematic looting has exceeded all limits to include murder as well as stealing and looting.”e went on to describe a “igorously organized”rocess in which the paramilitary groups followed the Syrian Army and pillaged at will, sometimes “ragging homeowners from their houses and robbing the houses right in front of their eyes.”nother common tactic, he said, was to pour gasoline on walls and set a fire “ntil the tiles on the floors and walls expand due to the heat. Then they put out the fire, remove the tiles and resell them.”

The reporter, an Aleppan named Rida al-Basha, described the neighborhoods where this had taken place and named the militias, including the notorious Tiger Forces, whose leaders include well-known thugs. At the end of the interview, Basha said that he had pleaded with the city government and other journalists to expose these crimes, but that everyone was too frightened. After the report, Basha repeatedly said he was threatened with death, and he is said to have fled the country.

Publicly, the Syrian state deplores these crimes, but privately it seems to condone them as a form of compensation for the paramilitary groups, whose support Assad needs to supplement his decimated army. (The rebels do it, too, and sometimes offer an Islamic justification: ghana’m al-harb, the spoils of war.) Only when the looting starts to spin out of control, as it did in Aleppo in January and February, is there a crackdown. But such systematized thievery has become entrenched in an economy that is more corrupt than ever. Regime-allied armed groups often set up checkpoints and extort taxes from farmers and businessmen, making it that much harder to earn a living. “ou pay through the nose to transport anything anywhere,” was told by a man who manufactures plastics and has seen most of his profit margin disappear. “ashar can’ do anything about this. He is in survival mode.”eanwhile, war profiteers (tujjar al-harb —nother phrase you hear a lot in Syria nowadays) have become well-known figures. I was amazed to see new, lavish-looking restaurants in Damascus; some of them belong to men who are said to have grown rich from crime. Members of the old Damascus business elite wince when they describe the clientele in these places. One friend told me, “ou see a guy in a business suit in a fancy bar talking to a thuggish-looking guy in fatigues, and you understand the conversation without hearing anything.”ome of these men are also widely said to sell oil to rebel groups for huge profits.

Late last year, Iran abruptly suspended oil deliveries, which have become a lifeline for Syria. Iran acted because it was angry about the amount of its fuel that was being diverted and sold to rebels by regime-connected middlemen, I was told by a Syrian who has close ties to Hezbollah, Iran’ ally. The suspension created a serious fuel crisis in winter. Iran resumed its supplies in mid-February, but Tehran has little choice: It needs Assad as much as he needs it. There are reports of similar tensions with the Russians, who are more interested in brokering an end to the fighting than Assad is. The Syrian businessman put it like this: “ashar is like a man with two false legs —ne is Russia and one is Iran. He keeps hopping from one leg to the other, because the ground he is standing on is very hot.”

All this may sound awfully precarious for Assad. But in a sense, it is just a more extreme form of the game Assad and his father have played for decades. The Assad regime arose after an unstable period during the 1950s and ’0s, when Syria was shaken by coups and countercoups. Hafez al-Assad, Bashar’ father, triumphed in part by managing a constellation of rivals who hated one another but were all dependent on him. They knew that without him at the center, chaos would return, and that would be bad for business. This is truer than ever today. And it has a secondary effect, not unimportant: Many ordinary people now see Assad as their only hedge against a far more toxic kind of chaos.

My Syrian businessman friend told me that he twice gathered about a dozen people for dinner and offered them a hypothetical in strict confidence. It is up to you to name the next president of Syria, he said. Whom would you choose? The guests were all Syrians, and none supported the regime. To his surprise, almost all of them named Assad. When he asked why, the same answer came back again and again: Assad is the only one who can protect us against his own devils.

While I was in Syria, I found myself thinking now and again about the vast street demonstrations I saw in Iran in 2009. This was just after the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, when millions of people marched peacefully through the streets of Tehran. The crowd drew from every social class, every generation. A peaceful popular movement seemed to have brought the theocratic regime to its knees. Soon after the largest march, on June 15, the police and the Basij militia came out in force, spraying tear gas and beating people with truncheons. Protests went on for months, but eventually they dwindled to a hard core, and the regime crushed the movement with relative ease. I often wondered about all those people I saw in the streets on June 15. At the time, their absence felt a bit like cowardice to me. Now it feels more like a kind of earned political wisdom. They stayed home not because they preferred the regime but because they did not want to risk death. And perhaps because they did not want to see their country torn apart.

Anas Joudeh, the Damascus lawyer, told me that the absence of this kind of wisdom is precisely what doomed Syria. For years, he said, he and his friends cast around looking for someone to blame for the failure of the 2011 revolution. “e often asked, If only this, or if only that,”e said. “ut now I feel that what happened was destiny. Because there are no political or social forces in Syria. The regime emptied them out. So when the regime looked to make a deal in 2011, there was no one there.” took Joudeh to be saying that the regime might have been willing to share power, in some limited way, if the opposition had been more organized, more conciliatory. Perhaps it is naïe to suggest that the regime could have offered genuine reforms of its own accord. Police states are not known for voluntarily giving up power in the interest of building a better future. Assad has spoken the language of reform ever since he inherited his role from his father in 2000, and he has never followed through on any of it. Still, there is one story that has haunted me.

On March 30, 2011, Assad delivered a televised speech to Syria’ rubber-stamp Parliament that is widely viewed in retrospect as a crucial step in the country’ descent into war. He had kept silent during the previous two weeks of protest and violence. Some of his advisers and proxies had hinted, in the days beforehand, that he would make historic proposals, offering a hand to the protesters and paving the way for genuine national reconciliation. Much of the region tuned in as Assad walked up a red carpet into the Parliament building past a cheering crowd. But his speech quickly turned into a familiar, embarrassing spectacle, with lawmakers chanting his name and interrupting his speech with fawning accolades. Assad delivered a hard-line speech deriding the protesters as dupes of a foreign-backed plot to destroy the country. He closed on an ominous note, saying: “here is no compromise or middle way in this. What is at stake is the homeland, and there is a huge conspiracy. ... We have never hesitated in defending our causes, interests and principles, and if we are forced into a battle, so be it.”

One former regime official told me that he recalls watching the speech with a sense of shock and dismay. He and other high-ranking officials had heard in advance the details of what the speech was supposed to say. It had been drafted, they were told, by Vice President Farouk al-Shara, and it emphasized reconciliation with the protesters. Shara had received input from several other top officials with similar inclinations. This version of the speech even had the support of Hezbollah’ leaders, who believed that genuine gestures of compromise could head off a war, the former official said. Other people close to the regime have echoed this account, though there are analysts who are skeptical; it’ almost impossible to be sure about what happens in Assad’ secretive inner circle.

What is certain is that Assad did not deliver the speech that was expected. Instead, the former official said, he scrapped it at the last minute in favor of a much more aggressive text. “hen I heard the speech, my feeling was —e are in for a long fight,”he former official told me. “ was in my office. We looked around at each other and did not say a word.”e remains convinced that if Assad had given the other speech, the past six years would have unrolled very differently, and oceans of blood might have been spared.

Few people in Syria have any patience for this kind of wistful talk. Former regime critics like Joudeh now confine themselves to pressing for the smallest-bore reforms: better training for the police and judiciary, more local control in towns and cities, a diminished role for the Baath Party and its outmoded Arab Nationalist bromides. But even this will not happen while the war continues, and it may be even less likely afterward. Assad has a genius for corrupting everyone around him, in ways large and small (some of his advisers are said to be receiving land in bombed-out rebel areas). Even giving in to these mild measures of hope can start to make you feel dirty, as if you had been played for a fool. The alternative, of course, is an ecumenical cynicism toward everyone and everything. This is the default mentality for most Syrians I know.

In my time in Syria, I met one person who seemed to evade both of these traps. I hesitate to use the word “ero,”ecause he would violently reject it. But he held onto a dogged civic idealism that was divorced from hope of any kind. In a sense, he was the inverse of Abu Sami, the professor who shut himself off from the war inside his home. He was a 57-year-old engineer named Tarif Attora, who appeared to be working himself to death running a group called the Aleppo People’ Initiative. He and his teams repair water pipes and electricity lines and supply food and medical aid to people in need. They do this in both regime and rebel areas, unlike the White Helmets, the rescue group that was lionized in an Academy Award-winning documentary. He is the only person I know who has the unreserved admiration of both rebel leaders and die-hard regime loyalists.

I met Attora in the initiative’ office, where he sat at a battered desk with a vast map of the city —ast and west —n the wall behind him. The desk was covered with stacked files and old coffee mugs, and he interrupted our talk several times to bark instructions to site managers. (“on’ strain the lines. You’e getting 50. It should be 25 to 30.” He has steel-gray hair that is cut short and flat on the top of his head, and his face —tark, creased with vertical lines, square-jawed —ooks a bit like Albert Camus’ might have if he lived a decade longer.

The initiative started in July 2012, when Attora gathered roughly 30 engineers and other professionals —ll Aleppo residents —o talk about how they could help protect the city. Some were with the opposition, some were not, and there were arguments. They agreed on one thing: the need to keep the lights on and the water running. So they asked the authorities for permission and began reaching out to all the rebel groups. Soon they had hundreds of volunteers working with them and repair crews going everywhere, even the front lines. The state water company supplied pipes and materials, but apart from that, the initiative is entirely self-funding, Attora said. Six of its members have been killed. Many others have been wounded, including Attora.

He told me several harrowing stories about his work in what he called “ot zones.”wice he came close to being killed, and his back is now broken in two places. Jihadi groups were in control of Aleppo’ main power plant for more than a year, so he ended up dealing with them a lot. Once, he saw something that left him traumatized for months. He asked me not to report the details, because it might anger the people involved and limit his ability to work with them. Despite the trauma —hich still haunts him —e did not want to jeopardize his ability “o continue working in all areas,”e said.

I asked Attora why he does it, and he hesitated. He seemed uncomfortable dealing with abstractions. “reedom doesn’ come from destroying the country,”e said as he put out what must have been his 10th cigarette since our conversation started and lit another. “ook, people consider me opposition,”e said. “ut the way I see opposition —t doesn’ mean I must destroy my country and put us back 100 years. That kind of opposition is a betrayal of the country, a betrayal of the ideals I’e grown up with.”

He seemed unsatisfied with his words, and he glanced around the room, as if he were looking for an excuse to stop talking and get back to his engineers. It was getting dark outside. “e all served the politics of other countries in our own land, whether we knew it or not,”e said. “verybody has to wake up. To be brave, to admit they’e made mistakes, to come back to the right way.”

I stood up to shake Attora’ hand and say goodbye. His face cracked into a smile, and the phone rang. He picked it up, and instantly he was at home again, supervising repairs on a power line that would probably be blown up again tomorrow.

MANILA —resident Rodrigo Duterte warned on Wednesday that he may declare martial law throughout the Philippines to deal with the threat of Islamist militancy, making the remarks one day after he imposed military rule on a southern island.

Mr. Duterte’ statement came after he cut short a trip to Russia on Tuesday night and announced he was placing the entire southern island of Mindanao under military control because of the growing insurgent threat there. The declaration came after Abu Sayyaf extremists backed by members of another insurgent group burned down buildings in the predominantly Muslim city of Marawi to prevent troops from arresting a top rebel commander.

On Wednesday, he raised the prospect that Islamic State-inspired rebels could gain a foothold in the north of the country. “f I think that the \b ISIS\b0  has already taken foothold also in Luzon, and terrorism is not really far behind, I might declare martial law throughout the country to protect the people,”e said, referring to the country’ largest and most populous island.

“t is our constitutional duty to ensure that every family, every community, all Filipinos, are assured to live in peace and harmony,”e said, while pledging to the public that “here will be no abuses.”

The situation in the south became more tense Wednesday after the Roman Catholic Church said gunmen had taken a priest and several churchgoers hostage in the city of Marawi as fighting raged between government forces and militants.

Mr. Duterte, speaking earlier in a video message released by his communications team, sought to calm public fears, even as he compared his imposition of martial law to that of the strongman Ferdinand Marcos, who subjected the entire country to martial law in the name of fighting communism.

“t would not be any different from what President Marcos did,”r. Duterte said in the video. “’ be harsh.”

His spokesman said on Tuesday night that martial law would last only 60 days, but Mr. Duterte said he was prepared to extend it to a year.

His statement came as government forces were trying to quell fighting in Marawi, a city of about 200,000 that has become a hotbed of Islamist militancy.

The National Union of Peoples’awyers in Manila said it was raising “erious concerns on what appears as a sledgehammer, knee-jerk reaction”o the situation on Mindanao.

“he recent incidents in Marawi do not justify the shotgun declaration of martial law,”aid Ephraim Cortez, head of the lawyers’nion. “he declaration of martial law should be an option of last resort.”

Marcos ruled the country for two decades, much of it under martial law, leading to widespread human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings. He was forced into exile in Hawaii in 1986 after his government was toppled by the so-called People Power Revolution. He died in exile in 1989.

Sporadic violence continued on Wednesday in Marawi, as insurgents burned down the Catholic church where the hostages were abducted and set fire to at least two other buildings. They also hoisted a black Islamic State flag in the area.

Bishop Edwin de la Peñ said the gunmen were holding at least six people, including the priest. He said a man who identified himself as one of the gunmen called him and demanded that government troops stop their search for the rebel leader.

“he man on the phone identified himself as one of the leaders of the armed group who confirmed holding hostage”he priest and others, Bishop de la Peñ said. He added that the man warned they would harm the hostages if the troops and the police did not pull back.

But as Mr. Duterte was warning about the dangers of Islamist militancy, his own military was playing down the threat from the Islamic State.

Col. Edgard Arevalo, a military spokesman, said the situation in Marawi had “tabilized”ith security forces in full control. He said the armed men were “ot ISIS”ut members of a local terrorist group.

“he news being circulated by these terrorists and their sympathizers are spurious and are meant to spread lies and disinformation,”e said. “t is propaganda to attract foreign terrorists’upport and recognition.”

The military said earlier that it launched the operation against the rebels with the police on Tuesday night in hopes of arresting Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the Abu Sayyaf group, who was reportedly in the area and had been joined by an additional 100 militants belonging to a group called Maute.

Both groups have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and vowed to carry out attacks across the Philippines, Asia’ center of Catholicism.

The Maute group was responsible for bombing a night market in Davao City in September, killing 15 people, and trying to bomb the United States Embassy in Manila last year.

Abu Sayyaf has long targeted both locals and foreigners in the region. The group beheaded a German hostage this year and killed two Canadians in 2016.

Thirty-seven members of Maute, including a Malaysian and three Indonesians, were killed last month in clashes, also in the south.

Mr. Hapilon, a senior Abu Sayyaf leader, is considered one of the most radical members of the group. He pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in videos circulated online last year.

Among Attack's Victims, Girls as Young as 8, Often With Mothers in Tow

LONDON -- Some of the girls had barely reached puberty. Many had come with parents in tow. At least one was only 8 years old.

It is not clear whether the bomber who killed 22 Ariana Grande fans, wounded 59 and incited a mass panic at her concert in the Manchester Arena on Monday night had intended for his homemade device to explode among victims who were young and included many girls.

But the traumatizing effects put the attack in the same category as the Beslan school siege in Russia, the Peshawar school massacre in Pakistan and the mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria: It grabbed the adult world's attention in ways that some indiscriminate attacks do not.

''It's intended to shock,'' said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and an authority on the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Manchester assault. ''You get maximum fear by attacking a vulnerable population: kids.''

Mr. McCants, the author of the 2015 book ''The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State,'' said that ''the thing with ISIS is, it doesn't worry about offending mass public opinion.''

By Tuesday evening, the police in Manchester had publicly identified only a few of the dead. The details that were emerging about the victims reinforced what Mr. McCants and others described as the shock value craved by plotters of such attacks.

Saffie Rose Roussos, 8, the youngest of the confirmed dead, was described by her school principal, Chris Upton, as a ''beautiful little girl'' who was ''quiet and unassuming, with a creative flair.''

Saffie, from Lancashire in northwestern England, attended the concert with her mother and older sister. News reports said both had been hospitalized for injuries.

''The thought that anyone could go out to a concert and not come home is heartbreaking,'' Mr. Upton said.

The first victim to be publicly identified was Georgina Bethany Callander, an 18-year-old health and social care student known for her big smile and love of pop music.

Ms. Callander's Instagram account showed a young and joyful woman who appeared to adore animals and Disney films. She had also posted a photograph of her driver's license, which she received in December 2016. News reports said she had died with her mother at her side. Old photographs on social media showed her wearing glasses and braces.

She was a student at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire, where administrators expressed ''enormous sadness'' and said they would offer counseling to students.

Ms. Callander was a fan of the bands Fifth Harmony and One Direction. On her Instagram account, she named ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''Captain America'' as her favorite films, and ''Wicked'' as her favorite musical.

Her social media accounts show a young and idealistic woman who had criticized a dog meat festival in Yulin, China, and supported the Women's March on London in January.

The Manchester Evening News identified another victim, John Atkinson, 26, from Radcliffe, a town in the Manchester area. A fund-raising page was established for his funeral.

A fourth victim was identified late Tuesday as Kelly Brewster, 32, from Sheffield, an avid concertgoer who had attended the show with her sister, Claire Booth, 34, and Ms. Booth's 11-year-old daughter, Hollie. Relatives said Ms. Brewster died trying to shield them from the blast. Hollie's legs were broken, her mother's jaw was broken, and both suffered wounds from shrapnel, including embedded bolts in their bodies, The Guardian reported.

Payton Williams, one of Ms. Brewster's friends, who confirmed she had died, said she was ''very smart, funny lady with a heart of gold.''

As the authorities scrambled to identify the dead and as relatives scoured local hospitals for their loved ones, one mother clasped a framed photograph of her young daughter and made a tearful appeal on BBC television for any information about her, saying she was worried sick. Dozens of others posted photographs of the missing on social media, asking for information about relatives and friends.

Some Polish citizens were among the missing, said Jakub Krupa, the British correspondent of the Polish Press Agency, citing the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Ms. Grande, 23, an American singer, attracts legions of young female fans to her concerts, chaperoned by parents. She has also broadened her fan base by promoting lesbian and gay rights and celebrating diversity -- concepts that are antithetical to the Islamic State and similar jihadist extremist groups.

While it is possible that Ms. Grande's particular audience may have been deliberately targeted, some terrorism experts said it was the size and youth of the audience and the vulnerability of the event that had enticed a group like the Islamic State.

''It was particularly attention-grabbing,'' said Brian Nussbaum, a professor at the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at the University of Albany. ''ISIS is more interested in violence for violence's sake and the momentum that comes with that.''

Others said the predominant gender of Ms. Grande's audience may have been directly relevant for the attack plotters.

''These are young girls, they haven't started their lives, so everybody's sitting in their homes and saying, 'My God, they went to have fun and look what they got,''' said Wagdy Loza, a psychiatry professor at Queen's University in Ontario and former chairman of the Extremism/Terrorism section of the Canadian Psychological Association.

''The psychological impact is much, much more than killing a bunch of people in an office or workers in their 50s,'' he said. ''It does make more impact when you see children.''

People in Manchester, England, mourned the bomb victims on Tuesday. An expert on the Islamic State said shock was the goal: ''You get maximum fear by attacking a vulnerable population: kids.''

â– rime Minister Theresa May announced on Tuesday night that Britain's threat level had been raised to critical, its highest level, suggesting that another terrorist attack may be imminent.

â– he bomber who carried out the deadly attack at the Manchester Arena was identified by the police on Tuesday as Salman Abedi, 22, the son of Libyan immigrants.

â– r. Abedi died at the scene after detonating an improvised explosive device. The police were investigating whether he had any help.

â– r. Abedi had traveled to Libya multiple times, but the timing of his last trip is not known, according to a senior United States official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

â– he Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Monday night bombing that killed 22 people and wounded 59 others after a concert by the American pop star Ariana Grande.

â– hildren and teenagers who were attending a concert were among the dead, the police said, including an 8-year-old girl. Ms. Grande was not hurt.

â– art of the investigation led police officers in Manchester to arrest a 23-year-old man on Tuesday at a home southwest of the city center.

â– ritain's leading political parties agreed to suspend campaigning ahead of the June 8 election out of respect for the victims of the attack.

View photographs from the aftermath of the attack.

What We Don't Yet Know

The police have not provided any more details about the bomber, Mr. Abedi, nor have they commented on his motive. It is also not clear whether he received help.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, identifying the bomber in its statement as one of the ''soldiers of the caliphate,'' but the extent of the militant group's connection is unclear.

We are also trying to find out:

â– hat planning went into the attack, and whether there are accomplices who are at large.

â– ow many of the 22 victims were children.

â– hat gaps in security at the arena might have abetted the attack, and what could have been done to prevent it.

Raids and an Arrest in Manchester

The police have said they are following leads and poring over surveillance footage to determine if the bomber had help or was part of a wider network. Shortly before noon on Tuesday, the police announced that they had arrested a 23-year-old man in the Chorlton-cum-Hardy neighborhood, southwest of the city center. His connection to Mr. Abedi is not clear.

Hours later, the police set off a controlled explosion and raided a house in Elsmore Road, in the Fallowfield district, where Mr. Abedi lived with his family, according to neighbors. The house is about 3.5 miles south of the arena.

First Victims Are Identified

Saffie Rose Roussos, an 8-year-old from Lancashire in northwest England, was killed in the attack. She was attending the concert with her mother and older sister, the Lancashire County Council said on Tuesday. News reports said Saffie's mother and her sister, who is in her 20s, were being treated at a hospital for their injuries.

Earlier, Georgina Bethany Callander, an 18-year-old health and social care student, was the first victim of the Manchester attack to be identified on Tuesday. News reports said she had died with her mother at her bedside.

Together, a Community Grieves

Thousands of people came together for a vigil in Manchester's Albert Square on Tuesday evening to remember the victims and comfort one another.

Olivia Roberts, 15, who attended the concert but was not injured, was still wearing her Ariana Grande tour T-shirt that carried blood stains as she stood in the middle of the crowd and hugged her mother.

''I brought her here because she needs to process what has happened. She needs to grieve,'' her mother, Lorraine, said as she stroked her daughter's head with one hand and held up a bouquet of flowers with the other. ''This is the world we live in now. We have to face up to it.''

After a minute's silence in honor of the victims, the crowd broke out in various chants, ''We love Manchester. Manchester will resist.''

Addressing the crowd, the Greater Manchester's police chief, Ian Hopkins, said, ''As your chief constable and as a father I cannot begin to imagine how anyone can carry out such an unthinkable act.''

Britain's home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, attended the event along with several faith leaders and Manchester residents from a range of backgrounds and ethnicities.

''This is about Manchester, our beloved city,'' said Ian Cross, 64, a resident of the city for over 40 years. ''Those young innocent girls were our children. We're here for them,'' he said as he broke down in tears, clutching tightly onto a bouquet of pink roses.

Azam Mirza, 24, a Muslim from Manchester, attended the vigil with a homemade placard that read, ''Hate no one. Love everyone.''

''Journalists asked me if I was nervous to come out here today. Why?,'' he asked. ''I'm here to support my community and condemn these hateful acts, just like everybody else,'' Mr. Mirza said.

Some Concertgoers Are Still Missing

Others in Manchester were still appealing for help finding loved ones who had attended the concert.

A number of local shops have sent food and supplies to the families waiting there.

Theresa May Pledges British Way of Life Will 'Prevail'

Speaking outside her Downing Street office on Tuesday, the British prime minister appealed for anyone with information about the bombing to come forward, and she vowed that Britain's way of life would ''always prevail.''

Mrs. May said the attack ''stands out for its appalling, sickening cowardice -- deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives.''

Queen Elizabeth II offered her ''deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event,'' and Prince Charles and his eldest son, Prince William, also issued their own statements of condolence.

The British government did not make any immediate comment on the claim of responsibility by the Islamic State.

President Trump, speaking in Bethlehem in the West Bank, where he was on his first foreign trip as president, condemned the bombing as a ''very horrible morning of death,'' and pledged ''absolute solidarity'' with Britain.

-- Sewell Chan and Prashant S. Rao

False Reports Quickly Circulate

Hours after the deadly attack in Manchester, false reports about the assailant and victims started to circulate across social media, often aided by Britain's traditional news media.

Two of the country's newspapers reported incorrectly that a gunman had been spotted near a hospital on the outskirts of the city in northern England. The local authorities quickly debunked that report through a tweet.

As in previous attacks across Europe, including those recently in France and Germany, false reports of people looking for victims of the attack also spread rapidly, racking up thousands of likes and retweets even though the information was incorrect.

Other posts included photographs of Ms. Grande, portraying her -- falsely -- in the aftermath of the blast.

The Terrorism Threat in Britain

The assault at the arena was the worst terrorist attack in Britain since the 2005 bombings of London's buses and subway, which killed 52 people.

British authorities, who say they have foiled numerous terrorist plots, had for months maintained the nation's threat level, set by the domestic intelligence service MI5, at ''severe,'' the second-highest level. That means the authorities considered an attack ''highly likely.'' And counterterrorism officials have been warning that as the Islamic State comes under more military pressure in Iraq and Syria, it will try to strike abroad.

-- Steven Erlanger

An Unrelated Terrorism Arrest

Soon after Britain raised its threat level on Tuesday night, the police in London said in a statement that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on ''suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism.'' The arrest was unrelated to the Manchester attack.

The man was arrested at Stansted Airport before he boarded a flight to Turkey and the arrest is linked to travel to Syria, the Metropolitan Police said. Officers were searching two residential addresses in north London, they added.

-- Niraj Chokshi

Blast Came After ISIS Plea

Last week, the Islamic State released a 44-minute video featuring fighters of different nationalities enjoining their supporters back home to carry out acts of violence. Among them was a man identified as a British citizen, according to a translation of the video provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute, which tracks jihadist propaganda.

Besides the threat last week, the Islamic State has repeatedly targeted Britain in its propaganda, though with little visible effect until this year.

-- Rukmini Callimachi

Who Is Ariana Grande?

The 23-year-old singer and actress began her career on the children's television network Nickelodeon. She played the character Cat Valentine -- whom she once described as ''simple'' -- on the hit shows ''Victorious'' and ''Sam & Cat.''

Ms. Grande has written in a Facebook post that playing Cat Valentine had helped her transition ''from teenager to adult.''

The concert that was attacked on Monday was part of a tour to support Ms. Grande's 2016 album, ''Dangerous Woman.'' Reviewing the tour's February stop at Madison Square Garden, The New York Times music critic Jon Pareles called Ms. Grande's performance ''a show of confidence, prowess and aplomb.''

In a tweet after the concert, she expressed her sorrow for the victims.

'God Save the Queen' Plays at Yankee Stadium

The New York Yankees held a moment of silence before the game against the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night for the victims of the attack. It was followed by a rendition of Britain's national anthem, ''God Save the Queen.''

''We stand in solidarity and unity with the people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain,'' said Paul Olden, the Yankees public-address announcer.

Arena Largest Such Venue in Britain

The Manchester Arena is the largest indoor venue in Britain, with a capacity of 21,000, or 18,000 for concerts. It was constructed as part of Manchester's bid to host the Olympic Games in 1996 and 2000. The venue is connected to the Manchester Victoria Station, which remained closed on Tuesday.

The Pennsylvania-based company SMG manages the arena, and Wes Westley, the president and chief executive of the company, described the precautions at the venue.

''It is obviously as tight security as anywhere in the states,'' he said in an interview. ''Backpacks are not allowed. Drinks are taken away from people. You have to go through very strict security to enter the arena.''

He explained that attendees arrive through a large public foyer, which is where the explosion occurred. The area is often where parents wait for their children after concerts.

Despite Security Measures, Concert Arenas Present 'Target-Rich' Environments

With bomb-sniffing dogs, bag inspections and rows of metal detectors at the entrance, the modern concert arena is in some ways a fortress.

But the blast that killed 22 people on Monday at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, highlighted the dangers that still exist along the perimeters of these buildings -- on the street or in public concourses where concertgoers and others may gather in large numbers, unexamined by any security force.

Investigators say the explosion at Manchester Arena occurred in a foyer just outside the venue's doors, a space that connects the arena to the nearby Victoria rail station. SMG, the company that manages the arena, said that it is not responsible for policing that space.

The episode immediately recalled the attacks in Paris in November 2015, when gunmen who entered the Bataclan theater during a performance killed 90 people. But Steven A. Adelman, the vice president of the Event Safety Alliance, a trade group, believes that comparison is not quite apt.

''It's less like the Bataclan than it is the Boston Marathon bombing, which also took place on a public street, surrounded by law enforcement,'' Mr. Adelman said. ''It was another target-rich environment for someone with bad intent.''

With the Manchester bombing, the multibillion-dollar music touring industry is once again confronting the specter of violence. Last summer, with the Paris attacks still a fresh memory, the singer Christina Grimmie was shot while signing autographs in Orlando, Fla., and in a separate episode in the same city a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub.

Ms. Grande's tour is scheduled to stop at the O2 arena in London on Thursday and Friday, but neither she nor the arena have said whether those shows would go ahead as planned.

In recent years, arenas and stadiums in most major markets have implemented extensive security plans, in part dictated by the demands of sports leagues. Sophisticated surveillance and screening technology -- as well as common-sense moves like bright lighting -- are now common. For some events, especially hip-hop shows, the pat-downs and searches are especially thorough.

Michael Downing, a former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, is now a security consultant at Prevent Advisors, a subsidiary of Oak View Partners, a company that advises sports and entertainment venues like Madison Square Garden. Mr. Downing, a counterterrorism expert, said that the Manchester attack demonstrated the need for further surveillance technology to monitor public spaces.

Entertainment venues, he added, have become standard ''soft targets'' for terrorists.

''This is something we've been anticipating, something we've seen in the electronic magazines of Al Qaeda and ISIS,'' Mr. Downing said. ''They encourage attacks on stadiums and arenas, malls, transportation hubs.''

Russ Simons of the Venue Solutions Group described security at such major spaces as a cat-and-mouse game with sophisticated attackers. ''Every time we make a move, that move is analyzed by our opponents,'' he said. ''They are looking for our next vulnerability.''

Several concert promoters and security professionals declined to discuss their procedures on Tuesday, for what one promoter called ''obvious reasons.''

Still, there is a broader concern in the music industry that no one wants the concert experience to become too militarized.

''Going to see a show or a sporting event as a kid is one of life's true moments of happiness,'' said Jonathan Daniel, whose company, Crush Music, manages artists like Sia, Fall Out Boy and Lorde. ''It would be terrible to lose that.''

Wes Westley, the chief executive of SMG, said in an interview that his company has been heightening its security procedures since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. After the Paris attacks in 2015, he said, the procedures were already strict.

''We already had tight security,'' Mr. Westley said. ''It was hard to get it any tighter. We wouldn't let people in the building.''

For many of the talent executives and concert promoters who plan tours, Tuesday began with calls from artists debating whether to go forward with their own shows. With sales revenue from recordings still down, musicians now derive more and more of their income from touring, and many say they are under constant pressure to stay on the road.

Marc Geiger, the head of music at William Morris Endeavor, said that the Manchester attack would cause venues and promoters to ratchet up their security measures once again, and that artists would demand more protections -- all of which would drive up costs.

But he echoed an optimism voiced by many in the industry on Tuesday, that the concert business would remain vigorously healthy and that fans would still buy tickets to see their favorite acts.

''I don't believe it is going to end an industry,'' Mr. Geiger said of the attacks. ''I do believe that in the near term a fear base has been established, which is what terrorism wants to do.''

Inside the American Air War Over Syria: A High Altitude 'Poker Game'

AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar -- The salvo of American cruise missiles launched at a Syrian airfield last month was intended as a one-time message to dissuade President Bashar al-Assad from mounting another chemical weapons attack.

But at the high-tech command center here, the challenges for Lt. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, who oversees air operations in the Middle East, were just beginning.

General Harrigian had to protect American and allied troops from possible retaliation by Syrian warplanes as well as keep up airstrikes in and around the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. All the while, Syrian and Russian air defenses were on heightened alert, raising the risk to American and coalition aircrews in their campaign against the militants, also known as ISIS.

''If the Syrians were going to make a run at our guys, we were going to be in a position to defend them ourselves,'' General Harrigian said in an interview. ''The intent was to be in position to support our guys and get back into fighting ISIS.''

Some of the military's most important operations have taken place thousands of feet in the air over Syria, all but invisible to the American public. A reporter for The New York Times was given access to the command center, offering a rare glimpse into how the military plans and orchestrates the complex ballet of strike, surveillance and refueling aircraft that keeps the war going around the clock.

A Base in the Desert

An outsize illustration of the principle ''if you build it, they will come,'' Al Udeid was constructed in a baking stretch of desert 20 miles south of Doha when Qatar had little air force of its own but was prepared to spend billions to build an airfield that a friendly superpower could use in a crisis. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration began basing American warplanes here to carry out airstrikes in Afghanistan, though their deployment was initially kept secret.

Al Udeid continued to grow in importance thanks in part to Saudi Arabia, which became uneasy about hosting the American military, including its regional air operations center. It was moved here in 2003 from Prince Sultan Air Base south of Riyadh soon after the American-led invasion of Iraq.

Today, the American-led command center at this heavily secured base oversees air operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other potential hot spots in the Middle East. The cavernous operations center is crammed with liaison officers from countries in the American-led coalition, the American military services, intelligence experts and officers who plan and direct the missions.

The challenge in operating in Syria's crowded airspace is clear from a glance at a large video screen inside the center that tracks aircraft across the region. Russian and Syrian planes are marked with yellow and orange icons; American and allied planes are delineated in green while civilian aircraft are blue.

Regular phone calls from Al Udeid to the Russian base at Latakia, Syria, are used to avoid conflicting operations. (An unclassified Gmail account is used as a backup.)

But as American destroyers in the Mediterranean prepared to launch dozens of cruise missiles on April 7 at the Syrian airfield used to mount a nerve-gas attack, it was clear that General Harrigian's mission was about to become more complicated.

Testing and Assessing

One big concern was that the stack of American warplanes providing close air support for Syrian fighters clashing with Islamic State fighters near Raqqa, their self-proclaimed capital, and the Tabqa Dam about 30 miles away. The aircraft were vulnerable to Syrian surface-to-air missiles that the United States could no longer ignore.

''In Raqqa, you are kind of right in the heart of the integrated air defense,'' said General Harrigian, who likes to climb into the cockpit of an F-22 to get a firsthand look at operations in Syria and at the American-supported Iraqi offensive in Mosul.

Another danger was that the Syrian Air Force might try to retaliate by mounting an airstrike against American or allied forces -- or the Syrian fighters they advise.

To deal with the potential fallout, General Harrigian developed a step-by-step plan intended to ''test and assess'' the Syrian and Russian reactions. In a situation in which the small measure of trust between the rival forces was gone, American aircraft would pull back, then gradually start edging back into Syrian airspace.

''What I told the guys was, 'I want a deliberate approach to regain our ability to operate in here. We've got to do it over time,''' General Harrigian recalled.

To keep up the pressure on the Islamic State, armed drones were positioned in and around Raqqa.

And, to give the United States a means of intercepting any Syrian aircraft that tried to strike American and allied forces, F-22s were ordered to fly around the clock in northeast Syria.

Though the F-22 is primarily an air-to-air fighter, it can also carry 250-pound bombs, which gave it the capability to conduct airstrikes against ISIS as it ventured south. F-22s are also equipped with an advanced electronic system to detect emissions from enemy radars and surface-to-air missiles.

Also adding to the American ability to monitor Syrian airspace, an American Awacs radar surveillance plane was positioned on the Iraqi-Syrian border, just outside the range of the SA-23 air defense system the Russians have deployed.

Neither the Syrians nor the Russians challenged the F-22s. General Harrigian next sent F-15Es into Syria, though he noted that he was careful to position them ''a little farther to the east.'' Though not stealthy, the F-15E's could carry larger bombs along with their air-to-air missiles and could quickly maneuver east if they were threatened by Syria's surface-to-air missiles.

''I wanted to make sure I had airplanes that could defend themselves against an integrated air defense missile getting shot at them, a SAM,'' General Harrigian said, referring to the missiles.

All the while, General Harrigian met daily with key aides to review intelligence and feedback from aircrews that had just conducted missions before deciding where to insert other aircraft.

''It was a poker game,'' he recalled. ''I put down a card; they put down a card. And I'm sitting at the head of the table deciding every day when I was going to put the next captain to go a little bit deeper in.''

An Hourslong Battle

But few plans survive contact with the enemy -- in this case, the Islamic State.

As a precaution against Syrian or Russian retaliation, the United States and its allies had withdrawn their Special Operations Forces who were training and advising local Syrian fighters near al-Tanf, a Syrian town close to the intersection of the Syrian, Iraq and Jordanian borders.

The day after the cruise missile attack, more than two dozen Islamic State militants, donning uniforms similar to those worn by the Syrian fighters, attacked the garrison, using suicide bombers to breach its defenses.

With Islamic State fighters inside the perimeter, caution was put aside. F-18s, F-15Es and a B-52 bomber raced to the scene.

''We were there in minutes over the top of them,'' General Harrigian said. ''My intent was, 'Hey, we are going to be deliberate about this, but if we've got to go support troops in contact, we are going to get after it.'''

After an hourslong firefight, the militants were routed. Several Syrian fighters were wounded, but there were no American or allied casualties.

Quieting the Enemy

In the weeks after, the Syrians, Russians and Americans have kept an uneasy watch on each other.

''My assessment is that they were worried about another strike occurring,'' General Harrigian said of the Syrian military. ''They used their radars basically to gain an understanding of where we were at.''

With neither the Syrians nor the Russians making obvious threatening moves, General Harrigian gave the go-ahead to insert other aircraft into Syria, including A-10s attack planes and B-52s. But the commander was still wary.

''We're not back to normal,'' he said. ''I still watch it every day.''

Those words turned out to be prophetic. On Thursday, Iranian-backed fighters that have supported Mr. Assad headed toward al-Tanf. Coalition planes fired warning shots at their convoy but failed to get it to turn around. Finally, the aircraft struck, destroying several tanks. That same day, a Syrian SU-22 aircraft that flew into the area was turned away by American F-22 pilots who did not fire a shot.

The situation near al-Tanf has been quiet since then, but no one is sure for how long.

Every victim of terrorism is innocent, and every one is to be mourned. But the bombing in Manchester, England, on Monday night that killed teenage or even younger fans of the pop star Ariana Grande, many accompanied by their parents and some clutching the pink balloons Ms. Grande had sent sweetly raining down at the end of her concert, is particularly wrenching.

By Tuesday, 22 people had died, and 59 others had been hospitalized, some with life-threatening injuries. The dead included 8-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos, who had come with her mother and older sister, and 18-year-old Georgina Bethany Callander, who had posted an image of her brand new driver’ license on Instagram.

The Islamic State said one of its “oldiers”ad carried out the bombing, which took the life of the man British police officials believe was behind it, Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old whose parents emigrated from Libya. It is still unclear whether Mr. Abedi acted alone or as part of a network. No one yet knows what motivated him to commit such a horrific deed. It is also unclear whether the Islamic State’ claim is legitimate. Only further investigation can answer these questions.

Meanwhile, as hard as it is amid the shock and the mourning, it is important to recognize this attack for what it is: an attempt to shake Britain —nd, by extension, the rest of Europe and the West —o its core, and to provoke a thirst for vengeance and a desire for absolute safety so intense, it will sweep away the most cherished democratic values and the inclusiveness of diverse societies.

The Islamic State wants nothing more than to watch Western democracies embrace its mad version of a holy war pitting Muslims against Christians, the newly arrived against others. This has been the goal of other attacks in Europe. With cold calculation, extremists have ripped apart the lives of people simply out enjoying themselves —hether at a concert or sitting around cafe tables in Paris in November 2015, or gathering for Bastille Day fireworks in Nice last year, or shopping at a Christmas market in Berlin in December.

Maximum vigilance is needed, and Britain raised its threat level from severe to critical. Public spaces must be made as safe as possible, even as people recognize that more attacks will very likely occur, despite our best defenses. In Britain, as in the rest of Europe and in the United States, it is critical that immigrants, especially Muslims, are not stigmatized. As Richard Barrett, former director of global counterterrorism operations at MI6, Britain’ foreign intelligence agency, said, “ngaging the community and letting the community inform us”s one way “o understand why people do this”nd to prevent future attacks.

Understanding is critical. The quickest way for open societies to lose the freedoms they enjoy and the Islamic State seeks to destroy would be to whip up divisive ethnic, racist and religious hatreds. But there will be those who try. The Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson tweeted on Tuesday: “e need a State of Emergency as France has. We need internment of thousands of terror suspects now to protect our children.”hen there was the unbelievably vile tweet by Katie Hopkins, a British commentator: “e need a final solution.”he later changed “inal”o “rue”n a new tweet after her original was widely condemned.

President Trump, who traveled to Europe on Tuesday after stops in Saudi Arabia and Israel, spoke to the British prime minister, Theresa May, and said what the world needs to hear: The United States stands with Britain. That spirit should bring together all citizens, of all countries, who —hatever their faith or birthplace —rieve now for the innocents cut down Monday night in Manchester.

Despite Security, Concerts Provide ‘arget-Rich’nvironments

With bomb-sniffing dogs, bag inspections and rows of metal detectors at the entrance, the modern concert arena is in some ways a fortress.

But the blast that killed 22 people on Monday at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, highlighted the dangers that still exist along the perimeters of these buildings —n the street or in public concourses where concertgoers and others may gather in large numbers, unexamined by any security force.

Investigators say the explosion at Manchester Arena occurred in a foyer just outside the venue’ doors, a space that connects the arena to the nearby Victoria rail station. SMG, the company that manages the arena, said that it is not responsible for policing that space.

The incident immediately recalled the attacks in Paris in November 2015, when gunmen who entered the Bataclan theater during a performance killed 90 people. But Steven A. Adelman, the vice president of the Event Safety Alliance, a trade group, believes that comparison is not quite apt.

“t’ less like the Bataclan than it is the Boston Marathon bombing, which also took place on a public street, surrounded by law enforcement,”r. Adelman said. “t was another target-rich environment for someone with bad intent.”

With the Manchester bombing, the multibillion-dollar music touring industry is once again confronting the specter of violence. Last summer, with the Paris attacks still a fresh memory, the singer Christina Grimmie was shot while signing autographs in Orlando, Fla., and in a separate incident in the same city a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub.

Ms. Grande’ tour is scheduled to stop at the O2 arena in London on Thursday and Friday, but neither she nor the arena have said whether those shows would go ahead as planned.

Sophisticated surveillance and screening technology —s well as common-sense moves like bright lighting —re now common. For some events, especially hip-hop shows, the pat-downs and searches are especially thorough.

Michael Downing, a former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, is now a security consultant at Prevent Advisors, a subsidiary of Oak View Partners, a company that advises sports and entertainment venues like Madison Square Garden. Mr. Downing, a counterterrorism expert, said that the Manchester attack demonstrated the need for further surveillance technology to monitor public spaces.

Entertainment venues, he added, have become standard “oft targets”or terrorists.

“his is something we’e been anticipating, something we’e seen in the electronic magazines of Al Qaeda and ISIS,”r. Downing said. “hey encourage attacks on stadiums and arenas, malls, transportation hubs.”

LONDON —oo cruel anywhere. Any attack on the innocent, whatever the location, whatever the time, and whatever the ideology it serves, offends us to our very souls. But a bomb whose target is the innocent young —hildren leaving a concert, excitedly full of what they’ seen, looking for their parents who had come to take them home —s outrage piled upon outrage.

Twenty-two are dead, at least 50 others injured, in last night’ terrorist attack at a concert venue in central Manchester. With every hour, we hear another fraught eye-witness account, learn of another father or mother in despair, another child still to be accounted for. I have family in Manchester. They are all right. But it isn’ only for oneself one worries. For others, too, the heart will break.

The eruption of indiscriminate violence in a peaceful place is terrorism’ purpose and our greatest dread, the horrible intrusion of menace where we had no reason to expect it, no matter how often we tell ourselves that nowhere is safe now. The unnaturalness of terrorism is its essence. It means to strike out of a clear blue sky. It means to shatter those bonds of commonality we have to take for granted or we cannot live.

So, this is terrorism’ perfect expression: the random massacre of kids coming out of a pop concert they’ no doubt been looking forward to and talking animatedly about for weeks, kids united only moments before in music and fun.

Manchester, my home town, is a music city, at the forefront of musical innovation for decades. When I was growing up there, those who weren’ aspiring musicians themselves lived next door to someone who was. I was exceptionally unmusical, but my brother played lead guitar for a well-loved band called the Whirlwinds which, after time, morphed into 10cc. They practiced in our living room.

When they spoke of their ambitions, I cautioned them against optimism. “ou and everyone else in Manchester,” said.

Liverpool had The Beatles but Manchester had The Hollies, Wayne Fontana and The Mindbenders, Herman’ Hermits. Later, there was punk: Something about its harsh sardonic insolence —orn of early de-industrialization, low wages and even lower clouds —ade Manchester a congenial venue. Manchester’ music scene exploded again in the 1980s and ’0s, thanks in large measure to the legendary entrepreneur Tony Wilson.

All that Manchester was best at, all its versatility and unexpectedness, all its artfully concealed sophistication, found a home in Tony Wilson, who read English at Cambridge, taught drama at a school in Oldham, near Manchester, and founded Factory Records and the Hacienda Club. If I had to define the soul of modern Manchester, I’ point to Tony Wilson: down to earth and dandified, of the people and rarified, all at once; sharp-tongued, honorable, hedonistic, more interested in art and conversation than celebrity and wealth. It was thanks to Wilson that Manchester became known as “adchester.”

And it’ a city of young people. Even on the most forbidding winter nights, the young congregate outside the bars and clubs, wearing not very much. The less you shiver, the harder you are. We will hear more over the coming days about about Manchester’ indomitable nature. How the city will not bend to terror. How death shall have no dominion; nor, either, the faceless men of violence. And it will be as true of Manchester as it can be of anywhere.

But there’ a suggestion of bravado, always, about these promises not to bend. Yes, we will overcome; but that’ because we have to. When those we are defying aren’ listening, we might as well be whistling into the wind.

Manchester has been bombed before. In 1996, the Irish Republican Army set off a truck bomb in the center of the city. Aiming at causing maximum damage rather than fatalities, the terrorists telephoned warnings of what was about to happen. There were many injuries but no one died. The wreckage was immense and, in the way of these things, rebuilding presented an opportunity for much-needed regeneration. It would be perverse to attribute Manchester’ economic success to that attack, but the city has indeed, and with proud self-assertion, risen phoenix-like from the ashes.

What has just happened at the Manchester Arena after a concert given by Ariana Grande is another order of catastrophe. There was no warning. The aim wasn’ publicity through destruction of property, but publicity through destruction of life. It is not to forgive the one to insist on how much worse the other is. Terrorists talk of themselves as soldiers, but something like spite enters acts of terrorism of this sort. Though the killing is indiscriminate, it is also personal. Life itself, and the living who exemplify life, are the targets.

There is, then, a sense in which Manchester, though it now belongs to a long list of terrorist casualty cities, can think of itself as picked out. It is a city possessed of a rare vigor. And a music arena lies close to the heart of that vigor.

So, yes, this has been an attack on the city’ very vitality. But the risk we face today is universal. If we want to find some consolation, it won’ be in speeches of municipal defiance, but in the stories, now coming thick and fast, of the assistance rendered not only by the emergency services, but by Mancunians of courage and goodwill who obeyed their deepest instincts in the face of danger and did all they could to comfort the injured and distraught. All is sorrow, but we still have kindness and pity.

President Trump’ Mideast Contradictions; Editorial

Given President Trump’ appetite for spectacle, Saudi Arabia could not have been a more fitting opening for his first overseas trip. The palaces, the fancy robes of King Salman and his court, the sword dance, even the creepy glowing orb used to inaugurate Saudi Arabia’ new counterterrorism center, seemed just the right props for a former television celebrity. His hosts went out of their way to indulge his weakness for flattery and deal-making. Mr. Trump tried hard to make amends to the Muslim world he had spent many months insulting.

This was necessary and long overdue. Mr. Trump’ indictment of an entire religion had disfigured his campaign and his presidency, undermined America’ long commitment to freedom of religion and gave fresh ammunition to the extremists Mr. Trump cannot defeat without the support of Muslim leaders.

Much of the rest of his message was more problematic. He said nothing about the need to advance the cause of human rights in Muslim societies that discriminate against women and minorities. He sketched an unsettling path forward in which the United States and the Sunni Muslims would join in common cause against not only the extremists but against Iran, a position that could come back to haunt him.

The man who once complained that “slam hates us”escribed it as “ne of the world’ great faiths.”e said the fight against terrorism was not a “attle between different faiths,”s some of his advisers had argued, but a struggle “etween barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people, all in the name of religion.”e urged Muslim leaders to drive extremists “ut of your places of worship,”“ut of your communities,”“ut of your holy land”nd “ut of this earth.”

But he provided no guidance as to how the war against extremism could be won, and showed no appreciation for the fact that Wahhabism, the fundamentalist Sunni orthodoxy that gives legitimacy to Saudi Arabia’ royal family, has inspired ISIS and most other regional terrorist groups. Nor did he suggest, as President Barack Obama often did, that Muslim countries are unlikely to wipe out extremism until they reform their economies and political systems so their people have ways to address their grievances, to participate in governing, to obtain an education and jobs.

Mr. Trump chose instead to single out Iran, the leading Shiite-majority state and Saudi Arabia’ main enemy, as a threat because of its support for militias in Lebanon and Yemen and for its backing of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Many of Iran’ activities are indeed destabilizing; but Mr. Trump’ friend Vladimir Putin has been no less responsible for keeping Mr. Assad in power.

In some ways Iran is an easy political target. Sunni Arabs feel threatened by Iran and are competing with Iran for regional influence. Israel detests Iran and so do many members of Congress. Yet to see Iran as implacably hostile is much too simple. Even as Mr. Trump reaffirmed America’ partnership with the conservative Saudi royals, Iranians were re-electing a moderate, Hassan Rouhani, as president and reaffirming their interest in engagement with the West.

While Mr. Trump was explicitly not lecturing Sunni Arab leaders on human rights, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson responded to the Iranian election by advising Mr. Rouhani to restore the rights of Iranians to freedom of speech and organization. The Saudi human rights record is no better than Iran’.

Mr. Trump’ determination to forge an anti-Iran alliance with the Sunni Arab states and isolate Iran could drift into military confrontation. The nuclear agreement negotiated between Iran and the United States could unravel, causing a split with America’ European allies. These are consequences that Mr. Trump, in his enthusiasm for Saudi Arabia, seems to have thought little about.

The Islamic State said one of its “oldiers”ad carried out the bombing, which took the life of the man British police officials believe was behind it, Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old whose parents emigrated from Libya. It is still unclear whether Mr. Abedi acted alone or as part of a network. No one yet knows what motivated him to commit such a horrific deed. It is also unclear whether the Islamic State’ claim is legitimate. Only further investigation can answer these questions.

Meanwhile, as hard as it is amid the shock and the mourning, it is important to recognize this attack for what it is: an attempt to shake Britain —nd, by extension, the rest of Europe and the West —o its core, and to provoke a thirst for vengeance and a desire for absolute safety so intense, it will sweep away the most cherished democratic values and the inclusiveness of diverse societies.

The Islamic State wants nothing more than to watch Western democracies embrace its mad version of a holy war pitting Muslims against Christians, the newly arrived against others. This has been the goal of other attacks in Europe. With cold calculation, extremists have ripped apart the lives of people simply out enjoying themselves —hether at a concert or sitting around cafe tables in Paris in November 2015, or gathering for Bastille Day fireworks in Nice last year, or shopping at a Christmas market in Berlin in December.

Maximum vigilance is needed, and Britain raised its threat level from severe to critical. Public spaces must be made as safe as possible, even as people recognize that more attacks will very likely occur, despite our best defenses. In Britain, as in the rest of Europe and in the United States, it is critical that immigrants, especially Muslims, are not stigmatized. As Richard Barrett, former director of global counterterrorism operations at MI6, Britain’ foreign intelligence agency, said, “ngaging the community and letting the community inform us”s one way “o understand why people do this”nd to prevent future attacks.

Understanding is critical. The quickest way for open societies to lose the freedoms they enjoy and the Islamic State seeks to destroy would be to whip up divisive ethnic, racist and religious hatreds. But there will be those who try. The Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson tweeted on Tuesday: “e need a State of Emergency as France has. We need internment of thousands of terror suspects now to protect our children.”hen there was the unbelievably vile tweet by Katie Hopkins, a British commentator: “e need a final solution.”he later changed “inal”o “rue”n a new tweet after her original was widely condemned.

President Trump, who traveled to Europe on Tuesday after stops in Saudi Arabia and Israel, spoke to the British prime minister, Theresa May, and said what the world needs to hear: The United States stands with Britain. That spirit should bring together all citizens, of all countries, who —hatever their faith or birthplace —rieve now for the innocents cut down Monday night in Manchester.

LONDON —ome of the girls had barely reached puberty. Many had come with parents in tow. At least one was only 8 years old.

It is not clear whether the bomber who killed 22 Ariana Grande fans, wounded 59 and incited a mass panic at her concert in the Manchester Arena on Monday night knew that his homemade device would explode among victims who were young and included many girls.

But the traumatizing effects put the attack in the same category as the Beslan school siege in Russia, the Peshawar school massacre in Pakistan and the mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria: It grabbed the adult world’ attention in ways that some indiscriminate attacks do not.

“t’ intended to shock,”aid William McCants, a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and an authority on the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Manchester assault. “ou get maximum fear by attacking a vulnerable population: kids.”

Mr. McCants, the author of the 2015 book “he ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State,”aid that “he thing with ISIS is, it doesn’ worry about offending mass public opinion.”

By Tuesday evening, the police in Manchester had publicly identified only a few of the dead. The details that were emerging about the victims reinforced what Mr. McCants and others described as the shock value craved by plotters of such attacks.

Saffie Rose Roussos, 8, the youngest of the confirmed dead, was described by her school principal, Chris Upton, as a “eautiful little girl”ho was “uiet and unassuming, with a creative flair.”

Saffie, from Lancashire in northwestern England, attended the concert with her mother and older sister. News reports said both had been hospitalized for injuries.

“he thought that anyone could go out to a concert and not come home is heartbreaking,”r. Upton said.

The first victim to be publicly identified was Georgina Bethany Callander, an 18-year-old health and social care student known for her big smile and love of pop music.

Ms. Callander’ Instagram account showed a young and joyful woman who appeared to adore animals and Disney films. She had also posted a photograph of her driver’ license, which she received in December 2016. News reports said she had died with her mother at her side. Old photographs on social media showed her wearing glasses and braces.

She was a student at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire, where administrators expressed “enormous sadness”nd said they would offer counseling to students.

Ms. Callander was a fan of the bands Fifth Harmony and One Direction. On her Instagram account, she named “eauty and the Beast”nd “aptain America”s her favorite films, and “icked”s her favorite musical.

Her social media accounts show a young and idealistic woman who had criticized a dog meat festival in Yulin, China, and supported the Women’ March on London in January.

The Manchester Evening News identified another victim, John Atkinson, 26, from Radcliffe, a town in the Manchester area. A fund-raising page was established for his funeral.

A fourth victim was identified late Tuesday as Kelly Brewster, 32, from Sheffield, an avid concertgoer who had attended the show with her sister, Claire Booth, 34, and Ms. Booth’ 11-year-old daughter, Hollie. Relatives said Ms. Brewster died trying to shield them from the blast. Hollie’ legs were broken, her mother’ jaw was broken, and both suffered wounds from shrapnel, including embedded bolts in their bodies, The Guardian reported.

Payton Williams, one of Ms. Brewster’ friends, who confirmed she had died, said she was “ery smart, funny lady with a heart of gold.”

As the authorities scrambled to identify the dead and as relatives scoured local hospitals for their loved ones, one mother clasped a framed photograph of her young daughter and made a tearful appeal on BBC television for any information about her, saying she was worried sick. Dozens of others posted photographs of the missing on social media, asking for information about relatives and friends.

Some Polish citizens were among the missing, said Jakub Krupa, the British correspondent of the Polish Press Agency, citing the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Ms. Grande, 23, an American singer, attracts legions of young female fans to her concerts, chaperoned by parents. She has also broadened her fan base by promoting lesbian and gay rights and celebrating diversity —oncepts that are antithetical to the Islamic State and similar jihadist extremist groups.

While it is possible that Ms. Grande’ particular audience may have been deliberately targeted, some terrorism experts said it was the size and youth of the audience and the vulnerability of the event that had enticed a group like the Islamic State.

“t was particularly attention-grabbing,”aid Brian Nussbaum, a professor at the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at the University of Albany. “ISIS is more interested in violence for violence’ sake and the momentum that comes with that.”

Others said the predominant gender of Ms. Grande’ audience may have been directly relevant for the attack plotters.

“hese are young girls, they haven’ started their lives, so everybody’ sitting in their homes and saying ‘y God, they went to have fun and look what they got,’”aid Wagdy Loza, a psychiatry professor at Queen’ University in Ontario and former chairman of the Extremism/Terrorism section of the Canadian Psychological Association.

“he psychological impact is much, much more than killing a bunch of people in an office or workers in their 50s,”e said. “t does make more impact when you see children.”

Dan Bilefsky reported from London, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Iliana Magra contributed reporting from London.

A deadly bombing struck an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, on Monday night. Traumatized fans, including children, screamed and ran. Parents separated from their children during the mayhem were told to go to nearby hotels, where many concertgoers had taken refuge.

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the bombing, the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since 2005.

The assailant died in the attack and a 23-year-old man was arrested Tuesday southwest of the city center. Investigators were examining security and dashboard camera footage to piece together events surrounding the bombing and identify potential collaborators.

Ms. Grande, who was unharmed, wrote on Twitter that she was “roken”fter the attack. “rom the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don’ have words,”he wrote. Her message was reposted hundreds of thousands of times.

Raids and an Arrest in Manchester

The police had said they believed the bomber acted alone, but investigators said they were canvassing leads and poring over surveillance footage to determine if the assailant had help or was part of a wider network. Shortly before noon on Tuesday, the police announced that they had arrested a 23-year-old man in the Chorlton-cum-Hardy neighborhood, southwest of the city center.

Hours later, the police set off a controlled explosion and raided a house in Elsmore Road, in the Fallowfield district, about 3.5 miles south of the arena.

Theresa May Pledges British Way of Life Will ‘revail’

Speaking outside her Downing Street office on Tuesday, the British prime minister appealed for anyone with information about the bombing to come forward, and she vowed that Britain’ way of life would “lways prevail.”

“et us remember those who died, and let us celebrate those who helped, safe in the knowledge that the terrorists will never win,”he said in comments broadcast on television.

Mrs. May said the attack Monday evening “tands out for its appalling, sickening cowardice —eliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives.”

Queen Elizabeth II offered her “deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event,”nd Prince Charles also issued a statement of condolence.

—ewell Chan and Prashant S. Rao

Trump Condemns ‘orrible Morning of Death’

President Trump condemned the bombing as a “ery horrible morning of death,”nd pledged “bsolute solidarity”ith Britain.

Speaking in Bethlehem, in the West Bank, while on his first foreign trip as president, Mr. Trump said the bombing underscored the message that he had delivered over the past several days about the need to confront the threat of terrorism.

“he terrorists and extremists, and those who give them aid and comfort, must be driven out from our society forever,”r. Trump said after a meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. “his wicked ideology must be obliterated, and I mean completely obliterated.”

‘veryone Started Crying and Screaming’

Laura Bruce, 18, was with her 25-year-old sister, Amy, in one of the arena’ upper tiers when they heard the explosion. “veryone below us just turned and ran,”he said. “ecause we were higher up, we could not get out for five minutes. When we came out, a man walked past us just covered in blood.”

Sophie Tedd, 25, had traveled from Darlington, England, to attend the concert with her friend Jessica Holmes. At the end of the concert, they heard a loud bang and initially wondered whether “ speaker had blown.”

Video from inside the arena showed a surreal scene of people scrambling for the exits amid pink balloons. The balloons were part of choreographed staging for Ms. Grande’ tour, after a segment with projections and lasers.

—ory Smith and Ben Sisario

False Reports Quickly Circulate

Hours after the deadly attack in Manchester, false reports about the assailant and victims started to circulate across social media, often aided by Britain’ traditional news media.

Two of the country’ newspapers reported incorrectly that a gunman had been spotted near a hospital on the outskirts of the city in northern England. The local authorities quickly debunked that report through a tweet.

As in previous attacks across Europe, including those recently in France and Germany, false reports of people looking for victims of the attack also spread rapidly, racking up thousands of likes and retweets even though the information was incorrect.

The Terrorism Threat in Britain

The attack at the arena was the worst terrorist attack in Britain since the 2005 bombings of London’ buses and subway, which killed 52 people.

British authorities, who say they have foiled numerous terrorist plots, have maintained the nation’ threat level, set by MI5, the domestic intelligence service, at “evere,”he second-highest level, for months. That means the authorities considered an attack “ighly likely.”nd counterterrorism officials have been warning that as the Islamic State comes under more military pressure in Iraq and Syria, it will try to strike abroad.

—teven Erlanger

Blast Came After ISIS Plea

Last week, the Islamic State released a 44-minute video featuring fighters of different nationalities, enjoining their supporters back home to carry out acts of violence. Among them was a man identified as a British national, according to a translation of the video provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute, which tracks jihadi propaganda.

Besides the threat last week, the Islamic State has repeatedly targeted Britain in its propaganda, though with little visible effect until earlier this year.

—ukmini Callimachi

Who Is Ariana Grande?

Ms. Grande said after the attack that she was “roken.”he wrote on Twitter how sorry she was for the fans who were killed and injured in the bombing.

broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words. —riana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 23, 2017

The 23-year-old singer and actress began her career on the children’ television network Nickelodeon. She played the character Cat Valentine —hom she once described as “imple”—n the hit shows “ictorious”nd “am & Cat.”

Ms. Grande has written in a Facebook post that playing Cat Valentine had helped her transition “rom teenager to adult.”

The concert that was attacked on Monday was part of a tour to support Ms. Grande’ 2016 album, “Dangerous Woman.”eviewing the tour’ February stop at Madison Square Garden, the New York Times music critic Jon Pareles called Ms. Grande’ performance “ show of confidence, prowess and aplomb.”

Arena Largest Such Venue in Britain

The Manchester Arena is the largest indoor venue in Britain, with a capacity of 21,000, or 18,000 for concerts. It was constructed as part of Manchester’ bid to host the Olympic Games in 1996 and 2000. The venue is connected to the Manchester Victoria Station, which remained closed on Tuesday.

The Pennsylvania-based company SMG manages the arena, and Wes Westley, the president and chief executive of the company, described the precautions at the venue.

“t is obviously as tight security as anywhere in the states,”e said in an interview. “ackpacks are not allowed. Drinks are taken away from people. You have to go through very strict security to enter the arena.”

He explained that attendees arrive through a large public foyer, which is where the explosion occurred. The area is often where parents wait for their children after concerts.

Take It From Milwaukee: Beware of Sheriff David Clarke

Milwaukee —hen David A. Clarke Jr., the sheriff of Milwaukee County, announced last week that he’ been appointed to a senior position at the Homeland Security Department, Milwaukee residents like me felt two things: relief that we might finally rid ourselves of his disastrous leadership, and deep concern about what his reported new role will mean for the rest of the country.

Sheriff Clarke (whose appointment the Trump administration has not confirmed) has attracted national attention on several occasions over the past year. In July, he drew scrutiny when, writing for The Hill, he suggested there was a “ivil war”etween law enforcement officers and members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Last week, CNN reported that he had plagiarized portions of his 2013 master’ thesis from several sources, including the American Civil Liberties Union and President George W. Bush’ book, “ecision Points.”Sheriff Clarke has denied this accusation, and called the CNN journalist who wrote the report a “leaze bag.” And with his image accompanying articles that have circulated online, Sheriff Clarke’ penchant for festooning his uniform with an abundance of pins and ribbons has drawn the ire of veterans and inspired comparisons to the over-adorned uniforms beloved by military dictators.

Locals have been aghast at his conduct for years, and our criticism goes far deeper than his outrageous statements, his bizarre fashion choices and even his academic dishonesty. Residents of this county have witnessed a series of embarrassing incidents and, much worse, human tragedy on Sheriff Clarke’ watch.

Many have seen the 2015 tweet in which he went as far as to say that the Black Lives Matter movement would “join forces with \b ISIS\b0 .”ess well known is the fact that a police union, on behalf of two deputies, successfully sued him in 2007 for religious proselytizing. A district court in Milwaukee found his actions unconstitutional, which a federal appeals panel upheld in 2009. Apparently, Sheriff Clarke thought it was appropriate to force his deputy sheriffs to listen to a Christian-themed presentation, without regard for the separation of church and state.

There’ more. Sheriff Clarke has exhibited petty vindictiveness in response to those who give him even the mildest rebuke. He’ been accused of harassment by Dan Black, a Riverwest resident who said he was detained and questioned by deputies after an interaction with the sheriff on an airplane in January. Mr. Black’ offense? Shaking his head as he walked by Sheriff Clarke, in his first-class seat, wearing Dallas Cowboys gear on the day the team faced Wisconsin’ Green Bay Packers in the playoffs.

More familiar to the national audience and more disturbing, especially to residents of Milwaukee, one of the most racially segregated cities in the country, is the story of Terrill Thomas, a 38-year-old inmate with bipolar disorder who died in 2016 while awaiting trial in solitary confinement in a jail Sheriff Clarke oversees. Mr. Thomas had gone seven days without water.

But what most Americans outside the Milwaukee metro area may not know is that Mr. Thomas’ death hasn’ been the only suspicious death during Sheriff Clarke’ tenure. Several people have died at a county jail since Sheriff Clarke took office in 2002, including a newborn baby who perished after her mother, Melissa Hall, gave birth on her cell floor. According to a federal lawsuit, Ms. Hall was shackled as she gave birth.

Perhaps the most bizarrely unhinged moment in Sheriff Clarke’ sordid career in Milwaukee came in March when he used a Facebook post to personally attack the city’ mayor, Tom Barrett. After Mr. Barrett criticized Sheriff Clarke for neglecting his duties in favor of Fox News appearances and book promotions, Sheriff Clarke became unhinged. Using the official page of the sheriff’ office, he mocked Mr. Barrett, saying, “he last time Tom Barrett showed up at a crime scene he got his ass kicked by a drunk, tire-iron-wielding man who beat him within inches of his life.”e was referring to a 2009 incident during which Mr. Barrett stepped between a deranged, tire-iron-wielding man threatening a grandmother and a 1-year-old child. Barrett was beaten and hospitalized after the assault, but the woman and child were saved from harm and the man taken into custody.

The timing couldn’ be better for him to step down from his post here. Milwaukee residents are fed up with our homegrown sideshow act. His job approval ratings have tanked in recent months. Were he to run in next year’ sheriff election, he would face an almost insurmountable primary fight for the Democratic spot.

The day we can finally rid ourselves of his malignant, sociopathic leadership can’ come soon enough. “ippee, giddy up, and leave was my response,”said State Senator Lena Taylor of Sheriff Clarke’ possible appointment. But it’ little comfort because Sheriff Clarke’ power will only expand with his new role, which he has said will begin next month. As Representative Gwen Moore said of the sheriff in Mic, “ can think of few men more uniquely unqualified to liaise with local law enforcement at this juncture.”

The rest of the country should not have to suffer what Milwaukee residents have. David Clarke is not fit for public office. He is incompetent, dishonest, petty, vindictive and cruel. Take it from someone who has had a front-row seat to his antics: Do whatever you can to keep him out of public service, and public life, permanently.

Manchester Attack Changes the Conversation for Trump Trip

JERUSALEM —resident Trump headed on Tuesday to Europe, where a devastating attack at a pop music concert in Manchester, England, grimly underscored his demand that Arab and Muslim countries drive extremists “ut of this earth”nd offered the first real test of how the president responds to a searing terror strike.

The second half of Mr. Trump’ foreign trip was intended to provide a platform for him to explain how his “merica First”ision would affect global trade, the war in Afghanistan, the Syrian civil war and the future of NATO and the European Union.

But the attack, for which the Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility, seemed certain to scramble the rest of the trip.

White House officials said the president’ schedule would proceed as planned. But his interaction with the continent’ leaders will be dominated by an urgent discussion about the security of public spaces and the world’ response to extremism.

That shift in topic could play into Mr. Trump’ political agenda at home, where he has repeatedly called for more restrictions on refugees and immigrants. And it could help the president make the case to world leaders for a more aggressive pursuit of terrorists in their communities.

In a statement Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump called the bombing at the concert, which killed nearly two dozen people and wounded scores, a “ery horrible morning of death.”e called on nations around the world to unite against a “ragedy of epic proportions”esulting from terror attacks, and to act against those who commit acts of terror.

“his is what I’e spent these last few days talking about in our trip overseas,”r. Trump said after a meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. “ur society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed. We cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people.”

Yaakov Peri, a former head of Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, said on Israeli television Tuesday morning that “he tragic attack in Manchester plays favorably for Trump, who in Saudi Arabia said that we will fight terror together.”

But the attack also poses some risks for Mr. Trump, whose responses to fast-moving events —ometimes dashed off in a Twitter message with a hashtag and an exclamation point —an sound off-key. In his first comments Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump used a playground epithet to describe people like the assailant in the bombing.

“ will call them from now on losers, because that’ what they are,”r. Trump said after the meeting with Mr. Abbas. “hey’e losers. And we’l have more of them. But they’e losers. Just remember that.”

The Manchester bombing adds to the distraction that Mr. Trump already faces as he makes his debut as America’ ambassador to the world.

At home, his White House is struggling to deal with scandal and chaos because of accusations that he interfered with the investigation into Russian contacts with his campaign and associates. Mr. Trump left Washington for his nine-day trip on Friday after a barrage of news stories documenting the expanding Russia inquiries, including accusations that he provided classified information to Russian officials in the Oval Office, and reports that he tried to pressure the former F.B.I. director investigating the matter.

Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other crises often interrupt presidents when they are abroad, throwing their highly choreographed diplomatic schedules into flux and forcing them to deal quickly with rapidly changing events.

In November 2015, while on a trip to Asia, President Barack Obama was repeatedly dragged into the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris, including Republican demands that the government respond by restricting the entry of Syrian refugees.

The following March, Mr. Obama was in Havana when bombs ripped through Brussels Airport and a subway station in the city, shifting attention away from his historic visit to Cuba and toward a renewed discussion about terrorism.

On Tuesday, it was Mr. Trump’ turn to be put on the spot by a grievous event.

In Israel on Tuesday, Mr. Trump began what was supposed to be remarks about his meeting with Mr. Abbas by pledging to support Britain and saying that “his wicked ideology must be obliterated, and I mean completely obliterated.”

His second event of the day — speech at the Israel Museum about the Middle East peace process —lso started with a return to the Manchester bombing and an acknowledgment that the subject of the rest of his trip would be the fight against terror.

“his trip is focused on that goal,”e said. “ringing nations together around that goal. Causing the hateful ideology that drives it so hard and seems to be driving it so fast.”

Mr. Trump began consultations with European leaders even before leaving the Middle East. In a telephone call with Theresa May, the prime minister of Britain, the president said he looked forward to discussing “he ways both countries can work with allies and partners around the world to defeat terrorism,”ccording to a White House summary of the call.

Even though the Manchester attack has the potential to overshadow the rest of Mr. Trump’ trip, it also echoed some of the themes the president had sought to emphasize during the first few days.

While visiting Saudi Arabia over the weekend, Mr. Trump urged the leaders of more than 50 Arab and predominantly Muslim nations to take responsibility for purging their lands of “slamic extremism” and of those who would kill in the name of religion.

“rive them out,”r. Trump said in a speech at a summit meeting in Riyadh. “rive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. And drive them out of this earth.”

And in Israel, the president had planned to try to kick-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in part by arguing that Arab and Muslim nations were united with Israel in fighting against terrorism and containing Iran, a longtime sponsor of terror.

Still, it was clear by the time Mr. Trump wrapped up his discussions in Israel and boarded Air Force One for Rome that the tenor of his trip had changed dramatically.

Mr. Trump, who had largely avoided his provocative Twitter messages since leaving on his foreign trip, posted one that included the flags of the United States and Britain.

“e stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom,”e wrote.

Good morning.

Here’ what you need to know:

•ISIS lays claim to attack in Britain.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility today for the attack on Manchester Arena, the deadliest terrorist assault in Britain since 2005. The death toll has risen to 22; an 8-year-old girl was among the first  victims to be identified.

The police said the bomber died in the explosion that tore through the venue as the pop star Ariana Grande was ending a concert Monday night. The attack, in which dozens were wounded, was one of the deadliest in Western Europe since 2015.

“t was meant to be a dream, not a nightmare,”aid a woman who attended the concert with her 14-year-old daughter. We spoke with some of the survivors.

Follow our live briefing for the latest updates.

•.S. budget’ winners and losers.

President Trump plans to unveil a $4.1 trillion budget today that would increase spending on the military and border security but cut deeply into programs for the poor.

The proposal includes huge tax cuts but does not change Social Security and Medicare. Here’  who would get what.

Our reporters say the plan is based on wishful thinking; it assumes an economic growth rate of 3 percent, when the post-recession average is 2 percent.

•ll in the family.

As President Trump’ trip overseas continues, the world is learning about the overlap between his relatives and his advisers.

His family-first approach has drawn some positive coverage, especially in Saudi Arabia, where the royal family is synonymous with the governing elite.

Mr. Trump met with President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority today, vowing again to “o everything I can”o achieve a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.

•eanwhile, back in Washington.

The Trump administration has moved to block an effort by the Office of Government Ethics to identify former lobbyists granted waivers to work in the White House or federal agencies.

A top official in the George W. Bush administration described the move as “nprecedented.”he White House has dismissed the ethics office’ inquiry as politically motivated.

And Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, misled Pentagon investigators about his ties to Russia, according to a letter released by a top Democrat in Congress on Monday.

There’ a full schedule of congressional testimony today, with Russia to the fore. Our live briefing will have the latest.

•oger Moore, who portrayed James Bond, dies.

The dapper British actor played the secret agent with a license to kill and tongue-in-cheek humor in seven films. He died today in Switzerland at 89.

•ustices reject gerrymandered districts.

The Supreme Court struck down two North Carolina congressional districts on Monday, ruling that lawmakers had violated the Constitution by relying too heavily on race in drawing them.

The decision could affect many voting maps, generally in the South.

Back Story

If you’e reading this with bifocals, you can thank Benjamin Franklin. He announced the creation of multifocal lenses on this day in 1785.

Like more than 200 million people today, he had to squint to see clearly. Later in life, he carried two pairs of eyeglasses: one for distance, another for reading.

So he pieced together two lenses, cut in half, in a single frame. “y this means, as I wear my spectacles constantly, I have only to move my eyes up or down,”e wrote to a friend.

Franklin, who has been credited with inventing the split-lens spectacles, although that is subject to debate, also produced a sketch of his D.I.Y. fix. It can be found in the Library of Congress.

Bifocal contact lenses came into clinical use in the 1950s, but they were not widely prescribed for decades. In 1986, bifocal lenses cost upward of $400 —lmost $900 in today’ dollars. Now, they can run $50 for a six-week supply.

Other advances to help those with presbyopia, or age-related farsightedness, include the ringlike corneal inlay, which is implanted under the eye’ outer surface.

And the tech-obsessed can look forward to the developing bionic eye.

Who is Sheriff Clarke of Milwaukee County? A Brief Guide

David A. Clarke Jr., the sheriff of Milwaukee County, was back in the news last week after announcing that he had been appointed to the Department of Homeland Security. (The Trump administration itself has not confirmed the appointment.)

Over the weekend, a CNN report accused him of plagiarizing parts of his 2013 master's thesis, a charge that he has denied.

Sheriff Clarke has become a controversial figure because of the treatment of prisoners at the Milwaukee County Jail he supervises, his rhetoric regarding gun rights and criminal justice and his excoriation of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Here's a quick look at the sheriff's moments in the spotlight.

Who Is David A. Clarke Jr.?

Sheriff Clarke, 60, joined the Milwaukee Police Department in 1978 and has been the Milwaukee County sheriff since 2002. He was appointed to the post by the state's Republican governor, Scott McCallum, and has since been re-elected four times as a Democrat, most recently in 2014. He has risen to prominence in recent years as a supporter of Donald J. Trump and as a conservative commentator on Fox News and Glenn Beck's radio network.

What has he done while in office?

Sheriff Clarke is responsible for the policing of the county's freeways, airport, parks and its courts, and he supervises the county jail. In 2009, he was put in charge of the Milwaukee House of Correction, but was forced to relinquish control in 2013. He has been accused of overstepping the responsibilities of his office since early in his tenure, according to a 2003 profile in Milwaukee Magazine.

Sheriff Clarke's stewardship of the Milwaukee County Jail, where four inmates died in 2016, has earned significant scrutiny. In November, Representative Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin wrote a letter to the Justice Department urging an investigation into the conditions at the jail.

At least two federal lawsuits have been filed against his office since December relating to those deaths, including one filed by the family of a woman whose infant daughter was pronounced dead after she gave birth in her cell. In May, a jury recommended that prosecutors file criminal charges against seven of the jail's employees over an inmate who died of dehydration after going a week without water.

What does he believe?

Though the sheriff has run for office as a Democrat, his positions on issues from gun control to abortion to mass incarceration are considered extremely conservative. A frequent presence on right-wing media since 2014, he has been an avid supporter of President Trump and endorsed him as a candidate in a speech at the Republican National Convention. He appears frequently on Fox News and in 2015 started hosting a weekly radio show for The Blaze, Mr. Beck's media network.

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]

On Gun Control:

Sheriff Clarke gained national attention in 2013, when he released radio ads urging civilians to learn how to handle firearms to protect themselves from criminals. ''Simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option,'' one of the ads said.

His 2014 primary race drew more than $600,000 in outside spending, according to the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel, as gun-control advocates poured money into his opponent's campaign, and the National Rifle Association called on support for the incumbent sheriff.

On prison reform:

Even as sky-high incarcerations rates have become a bipartisan concern over the last decade, Sheriff Clarke has remained staunchly supportive of harsh penalties for nonviolent criminals, a position that unites him with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a video promoting his 2014 campaign, he said that rehabilitation is ''not something for the criminal justice system to do'' and that inmate programs such as job training rewarded criminals and promoted recidivism.

On Black Lives Matter:

Some of the most attention-getting statements by Sheriff Clarke, who is African-American, have concerned the Black Lives Matter demonstrations for civil rights and against police bias, which he consistently refers to as ''Black Lies Matter.'' In 2015, Sheriff Clarke even went so far as to say that the movement would ''join forces with ISIS.''

What Happened Last Week?

On May 17, Sheriff Clarke appeared on a Milwaukee radio show and said he had been asked to serve as an assistant secretary in charge of the office that coordinates the Department of Homeland Security's outreach efforts for state, local, tribal, territorial governments and local law enforcement agencies.

The White House declined to comment on Sheriff Clarke's announcement, and the Homeland Security Department, in an emailed statement, said that ''such senior positions are announced by the department when made official by the secretary. No such announcement with regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made.'' Such an appointment would not require Senate confirmation.

On Saturday, CNN published a report alleging that the sheriff had failed to properly attribute his sources at least 47 times in his 2013 master's thesis on United States security, while studying at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.

Though Sheriff Clarke credited his source material using footnotes, according to the CNN report, he failed to use quotation marks to indicate which sections were taken verbatim from other sources, something that the school's guidelines on plagiarism require. A school spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that it had removed Sheriff Clarke's thesis from its online archive on Friday.

The sheriff attacked the CNN reporter who wrote the first report, Andrew Kaczynski, several times on Twitter, calling him a ''sleaze bag'' while reposting tweets from others pointing out that he had cited his sources.

I just sayin'. This "hired gun" Kaczynski did the same with me". Do I need to put that in quotation marks? https://t.co/aLxC3OCevQ -- David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) May 21, 2017

Given President Trump's appetite for spectacle, Saudi Arabia could not have been a more fitting opening for his first overseas trip. The palaces, the fancy robes of King Salman and his court, the sword dance, even the creepy glowing orb used to inaugurate Saudi Arabia's new counterterrorism center, seemed just the right props for a former television celebrity. His hosts went out of their way to indulge his weakness for flattery and deal-making. Mr. Trump tried hard to make amends to the Muslim world he had spent many months insulting.

This was necessary and long overdue. Mr. Trump's indictment of an entire religion had disfigured his campaign and his presidency, undermined America's long commitment to freedom of religion and gave fresh ammunition to the extremists Mr. Trump cannot defeat without the support of Muslim leaders.

Much of the rest of his message was more problematic. He said nothing about the need to advance the cause of human rights in Muslim societies that discriminate against women and minorities. He sketched an unsettling path forward in which the United States and the Sunni Muslims would join in common cause against not only the extremists but against Iran, a position that could come back to haunt him.

The man who once complained that ''Islam hates us'' described it as ''one of the world's great faiths.'' He said the fight against terrorism was not a ''battle between different faiths,'' as some of his advisers had argued, but a struggle ''between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people, all in the name of religion.'' He urged Muslim leaders to drive extremists ''out of your places of worship,'' ''out of your communities,'' ''out of your holy land'' and ''out of this earth.''

But he provided no guidance as to how the war against extremism could be won, and showed no appreciation for the fact that Wahhabism, the fundamentalist Sunni orthodoxy that gives legitimacy to Saudi Arabia's royal family, has inspired ISIS and most other regional terrorist groups. Nor did he suggest, as President Barack Obama often did, that Muslim countries are unlikely to wipe out extremism until they reform their economies and political systems so their people have ways to address their grievances, to participate in governing, to obtain an education and jobs.

Mr. Trump chose instead to single out Iran, the leading Shiite-majority state and Saudi Arabia's main enemy, as a threat because of its support for militias in Lebanon and Yemen and for its backing of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Many of Iran's activities are indeed destabilizing; but Mr. Trump's friend Vladimir Putin has been no less responsible for keeping Mr. Assad in power.

In some ways Iran is an easy political target. Sunni Arabs feel threatened by Iran and are competing with Iran for regional influence. Israel detests Iran and so do many members of Congress. Yet to see Iran as implacably hostile is much too simple. Even as Mr. Trump reaffirmed America's partnership with the conservative Saudi royals, Iranians were re-electing a moderate, Hassan Rouhani, as president and reaffirming their interest in engagement with the West.

While Mr. Trump was explicitly not lecturing Sunni Arab leaders on human rights, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson responded to the Iranian election by advising Mr. Rouhani to restore the rights of Iranians to freedom of speech and organization. The Saudi human rights record is no better than Iran's.

Mr. Trump's determination to forge an anti-Iran alliance with the Sunni Arab states and isolate Iran could drift into military confrontation. The nuclear agreement negotiated between Iran and the United States could unravel, causing a split with America's European allies. These are consequences that Mr. Trump, in his enthusiasm for Saudi Arabia, seems to have thought little about.

These are consequences that Mr. Trump, in his enthusiasm for Saudi Arabia, seems to have thought little about.

David A. Clarke Jr., the sheriff of Milwaukee County, was back in the news last week after announcing that he had been appointed to the Department of Homeland Security. (The Trump administration itself has not confirmed the appointment.)

Over the weekend, a CNN report accused him of plagiarizing parts of his 2013 master’ thesis, a charge that he has denied.

Sheriff Clarke has become a controversial figure because of the treatment of prisoners at the Milwaukee County Jail he supervises, his rhetoric regarding gun rights and criminal justice and his excoriation of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Here’ a quick look at the sheriff’ moments in the spotlight.

Who Is David A. Clarke Jr.?

Sheriff Clarke, 60, joined the Milwaukee Police Department in 1978 and has been the Milwaukee County sheriff since 2002. He was appointed to the post by the state’ Republican governor, Scott McCallum, and has since been re-elected four times as a Democrat, most recently in 2014. He has risen to prominence in recent years as a supporter of Donald J. Trump and as a conservative commentator on Fox News and Glenn Beck’ radio network.

What has he done while in office?

Sheriff Clarke is responsible for the policing of the county’ freeways and its courts, and he supervises the county jail. In 2009, he was put in charge of the Milwaukee House of Correction, but was forced to relinquish control in 2013. He has been accused of overstepping the responsibilities of his office since early in his tenure, according to a 2003 profile in Milwaukee Magazine.

Sheriff Clarke’ stewardship of the Milwaukee County Jail, where four inmates died in 2016, has earned significant scrutiny. In November, Representative Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin wrote a letter to the Justice Department urging an investigation into the conditions at the jail.

Two federal lawsuits have been filed against his office since December relating to those deaths, including one filed by the family of a woman whose infant daughter was pronounced dead after she gave birth in her cell. In May, a jury recommended that prosecutors file criminal charges against seven of the jail’ employees over an inmate who died of dehydration after going a week without water.

What does he believe?

Though the sheriff has run for office as a Democrat, his positions on issues from gun control to abortion to mass incarceration are considered extremely conservative. A frequent presence on right-wing media since 2014, he has been an avid supporter of President Trump and endorsed him as a candidate in a speech at the Republican National Convention. He appears frequently on Fox News and in 2015 started hosting a weekly radio show for The Blaze, Mr. Beck’ media network.

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]

On Gun Control:

Sheriff Clarke gained national attention in 2013, when he released radio ads urging civilians to learn how to handle firearms to protect themselves from criminals. “imply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option,”ne of the ads said.

His 2014 primary race drew more than $600,000 in outside spending, according to the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel, as gun-control advocates poured money into his opponent’ campaign, and the National Rifle Association called on support for the incumbent sheriff.

On prison reform:

Even as sky-high incarcerations rates have become a bipartisan concern over the last decade, Sheriff Clarke has remained staunchly supportive of harsh penalties for nonviolent criminals, a position that unites him with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a video promoting his 2014 campaign, he said that rehabilitation is “ot something for the criminal justice system to do”nd that inmate programs such as job training rewarded criminals and promoted recidivism.

On Black Lives Matter:

Some of the most attention-getting statements by Sheriff Clarke, who is African-American, have concerned the Black Lives Matter demonstrations for civil rights and against police bias, which he consistently refers to as “lack Lies Matter.”n 2015, Sheriff Clarke even went so far as to say that the movement would “join forces with \b ISIS\b0 .”

What Happened Last Week?

On May 17, Sheriff Clarke appeared on a Milwaukee radio show and said he had been asked to serve as an assistant secretary in charge of the office that coordinates the Department of Homeland Security’ outreach efforts for state, local, tribal, territorial governments and local law enforcement agencies.

The White House declined to comment on Sheriff Clarke’ announcement, and the Homeland Security Department, in an emailed statement, said that “uch senior positions are announced by the department when made official by the secretary. No such announcement with regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made.”uch an appointment would not require Senate confirmation.

On Saturday, CNN published a report alleging that the sheriff had failed to properly attribute his sources at least 47 times in his 2013 master’ thesis on United States security, while studying at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.

Though Sheriff Clarke credited his source material using footnotes, according to the CNN report, he failed to use quotation marks to indicate which sections were taken verbatim from other sources, something that the school’ guidelines on plagiarism require. A school spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that it had removed Sheriff Clarke’ thesis from its online archive on Friday.

The sheriff attacked the CNN reporter who wrote the first report, Andrew Kaczynski, several times on Twitter, calling him a “leaze bag”hile reposting  tweets from others pointing out that he had cited his sources.

I just sayin'. This "hired gun" Kaczynski did the same with me". Do I need to put that in quotation marks? https://t.co/aLxC3OCevQ —avid A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) May 21, 2017

Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. Some comments were edited for length and clarity.

One of our most-commented-on stories this week was about President Trump’ meeting with Russia’ foreign minister and its ambassador, in which he revealed highly classified intelligence, according to a current government official and a former one. The story received more than 5,400 comments on nytimes.com and thousands more across our social media pages. We published some of the most notable ones here.

Sharing Intelligence With Russia

1. ISIS is the enemy of both Russia and the US.

Other than Russia, what other nation has committed more military resources to rid Syria of ISIS? If ISIS truly is the enemy and we are serious about defeating them, maybe some collusion between Russia and the US is justified.

—Mike Edwards in Providence, R.I., reacting to an article about President Trump’ disclosure of highly classified information to Russia.

2. President Trump is now officially out of control. He has, to-date, not demonstrated any sort of competency to be POTUS. But that in and of itself is not an impeachable offense and is rather subjective in nature. But this news, that he has revealed highly classified information to a hostile adversary is beyond the pale.

He has no idea what he is doing and has now entered the realm of actions that are detrimental to the security of the United States. President Trump needs to be impeached.

—Scott in Middle of the Pacific.

This comment received more than 6,520 reader recommendations.

Jimmy Fallon

3 . Considering that the presidency is the most powerful job in our country, maybe interviews with candidates should be more serious and about policy. Let’ make sure that they’e actually qualified to lead before the election.

—John Kowalski, on The  New York Times’ Facebook page, reacting to a profile of Jimmy Fallon in which the late-night host addressed a controversial interview he conducted with Mr. Trump before the election.

4 . I appreciate Jimmy Fallon and his humor. It’ the one show that makes me laugh, introduces me to new music and allows me to escape the everyday politics that I read about and hear about every second. It’ the comic relief that we all so desperately need.

— Courtney Alex Wittenstein, on  T he Times’ Facebook page .

James Comey’ Memo

5. Mr. Comey’ memos sound like the actions of an experienced F.B.I. director: Collect evidence and cover your backside. I would have postmarked a letter to myself the same day and left the envelope sealed. Comey is apparently smart enough that he doesn’ need tapes. Although, any evidence of actual recordings would be quite hilarious. Once again, we find President Trump outclassed. He sure knows how to pick a fight with the wrong people.

—Andy in Salt Lake City, Utah, reacting to an article about a memo written by Mr. Comey saying that Mr. Trump asked him to shut down a federal investigation into Michael T. Flynn.

This comment received more than 4,430 reader recommendations.

6. If Trump obstructed justice in February, why is this a revelation in May? Would Comey be so principled if he were still in his job? Is anyone principled in the media and DC? Trump may be on very thin ice, but I do not see his tormentors as heroes.

The partisanship and dirty games are on display. We got Trump because of this. The insiders won’ be vindicated just because their witch hunt had an actual witch. They are showing themselves, too. I hope some statesmen will be revealed in this tawdry mess. Both parties should be held accountable for giving us [Trump] and [Hillary Clinton] as choices. And shame on us for allowing them to.

—TD.

Mogul to Millennials: Skip the Avocado Toast

7. From an employed millennial, your dollar was worth more than mine is today, and my avocado toast helps me cope with that. Thanks.

—Jason Heinen, on The Times’ Facebook page, responding to an article about an Australian real estate mogul’ suggestion that young adults would be more likely to buy a home if they cut discretionary spending.

8. My grandfather’ starting salary was $19,000 and he bought a house for $25,000. Houses don’ cost one year’ salary anymore. I make good money and don’ spend super frivolously and I still don’ think I’ be in a position to buy, nor am I sure I’ want to. I don’ want to deplete all of my resources on a house.

—Ben Traudt, on The Times’ Facebook page

Robert Mueller

9. Perhaps Mr. Trump will recognize finally that he cannot operate as he did when he led a family-owned business. The separation of powers was put in place for such circumstances as this investigation. I applaud the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel; a man of integrity, he is well respected and fair minded.

—Peyton Collier-Kerr in North Carolina, reacting to an article about the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, to oversee an investigation into ties between Trump’ campaign and Russian officials.

This comment received more than 1,750 reader replies.

10. What we are seeing is nothing less than an attempted coup by the dirty Democrats.

The Democratic Party is furious over losing the election, so it has decided to render Mr. Trump unable to function. The Democrats have no interest in the truth or in the facts. The political value of these “candals”ests with the existence of investigations; period. Mr. Trump will now find it impossible to cut taxes, reform health care, or conduct foreign policy. He is being effectively neutered in front of the world.

U.S. Says Its  ISIS  Fight Isn't Raising Civilian Risks

By ERIC SCHMITT; Michael R. Gordon contributed reporting.

WASHINGTON -- The United States began accelerating and intensifying its campaign against the Islamic State in January, at President Trump's direction, but it was not putting civilians in war zones at greater risk, the defense secretary said Friday.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Mr. Trump's decision to delegate more authority to commanders had put greater pressure on militants in Syria, Yemen and Somalia. And he said a tactical shift to surround Islamic State strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, was devised not only to ''annihilate'' thousands of fighters hunkered down there, but also to prevent them from returning to their home nations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, possibly to commit mayhem in those places.

In an hourlong news conference at the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis took issue with human rights groups and other critics who have warned that the military's new authorities freeing them from Obama-era constraints on airstrikes and raids against insurgents in Yemen and Somalia have jeopardized the safety of civilians in those countries.

''I want to emphasize here there has been no change to our rules of engagement, and there has been no change to our continued extraordinary efforts to avoid innocent civilian casualties,'' Mr. Mattis told reporters.

Amid a generally upbeat assessment of the campaign against the Islamic State -- known internally now as ''D-ISIS'' for ''Defeat ISIS,'' using another name for the group -- Mr. Mattis struck a sobering note, saying the fight ''is not going to be over soon.''

Mr. Mattis was joined by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Brett McGurk, the United States special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State.

The timing of their comments, which represent the most comprehensive report on the Trump administration's campaign against the Islamic State, was not happenstance: It came as Mr. Trump headed out on a nine-day visit to Saudi Arabia and Europe, where he will not only seek to rally support for the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but also try to gain commitments from NATO for more troops in Afghanistan.

Mr. Trump seemed pleased enough with his top generals on Friday to renominate General Dunford and Gen. Paul J. Selva of the Air Force, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each to a second two-year term.

At the Pentagon, General Dunford ticked off some of the campaign's accomplishments, including reclaiming 55 percent of the territory the Islamic State has seized in Syria and Iraq since 2014. He said the effort has also significantly reduced the group's ability to finance its terrorist operations and draw new recruits into Iraq and Syria, down to fewer than 100 a month from a peak of 1,500 a month.

Other senior American officials, including Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, have offered a more measured analysis of the impact of the global fight. Mr. Rasmussen said this month that ''the global reach of ISIS remains largely intact'' despite the group's territorial losses.

American officials now believe that about 40,000 prospective fighters from more than 120 countries have traveled to, or tried to travel to, the war zones in Iraq and Syria since 2014.

In explaining the Trump administration's strangle-the-stronghold strategy, Mr. Mattis underscored a looming menace: ''The foreign fighters are the strategic threat should they return home to Tunis, to Kuala Lumpur, to Paris, to Detroit, wherever.''

But it is not at all clear that the Obama administration's strategy, which General Dunford himself shaped and Mr. McGurk defended, was to let Islamic State fighters escape to fight another day. American military officers have also said it was the Iraqis' idea -- not the Americans' -- to send the Iraqi Army west of Mosul to cut off the city.

The Pentagon officials on Friday cited examples of the accelerated fight against the Islamic State.

After months of debate, beginning under President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump last week approved a plan to arm Syrian Kurds so they can help retake Raqqa from the Islamic State, a strategy that has drawn deep opposition from Turkey, a NATO ally.

American military commanders have long contended that arming the Y.P.G., a Kurdish militia fighting alongside Syrian Arab forces against the Islamic State, is the fastest way to seize Raqqa, the capital of the militants' self-proclaimed caliphate.

Turkey has objected strongly to arming the Kurds, raising fears that Ankara could curtail cooperation with Washington in the continued battle.

General Dunford said Friday that the United States had already stockpiled weapons and equipment -- which other officials said could include heavy machine guns, mortars, anti-tank weapons, armored cars and engineering equipment -- and would begin distributing them soon to Kurdish and Arab fighters in the anti-Islamic State coalition.

General Dunford highlighted the recent decision to allow American military advisers to accompany Iraqi troops down to the battalion level, particularly in operations in Mosul, although it is unclear how often that happens. The Americans' proximity to Iraqi forces in the complex urban terrain allows them to provide better support.

Mr. Trump's top advisers are also recommending sending 3,000 to 5,000 additional American troops to try to break a stalemate in the 15-year war in Afghanistan. That final decision, Mr. Mattis said, is still pending.

American forces now have broader authorities to combat militants in parts of Somalia and Yemen. But General Dunford cited a recent mission in Syria as a less recognized illustration of the latitude the Trump administration has given its commanders to carry out operations without prolonged review in Washington: an effort to take control of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River near Lake Assad, the nearby town of Tabqa and a local airfield.

That operation, which started in March, was the first time United States helicopters airlifted hundreds of Syrian fighters and their American advisers into battle behind enemy lines in the campaign against the Islamic State.

With Mr. Mattis suggesting that the fight against the Islamic State would still take years, not months, to complete, he was asked what success would look like.

''You've got to drive them down to a point that police can handle it,'' Mr. Mattis said. ''Police can't handle a force that's driving tanks and using artillery, or has thousands of fighters in mobile vehicles that allow them to range far and wide.''

American Airstrike on Pro-Assad Militia Draws Condemnation From Russia and Syria

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Russian and Syrian officials on Friday strongly condemned an American airstrike on pro-Syrian government forces in southern Syria a day earlier, calling it an act of aggression and rejecting the United States' justification for the attack.

''It is illegitimate, it is unlawful and the latest gross violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic,'' Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said in Cyprus, according to the state-run Russian news agency Tass.

After the airstrike, which American officials said was defensive in nature, Pentagon officials said on Friday that they were working with Russia to prevent similar ground incidents in the future, much as the two countries have done for months to avoid accidents in the skies over Syria.

''We had a proposal that we're working on with the Russians right now,'' Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Friday, declining to give details. ''My sense is that the Russians are as enthusiastic as we are to deconflict operations and ensure that we can continue to take the campaign to ISIS and ensure the safety of our personnel.''

General Dunford said that ''the ground is becoming increasingly complex and constrained'' in Syria, as Russian-backed pro-government forces advance closer to Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIS-held territory in Syria, and are already fighting in cities to the south like Deir Azzour.

The general said that, in addition to a communications channel between Russian officers in Syria and American officers in Qatar that is used to prevent midair collisions, another channel has been opened in which a three-star general in Washington now speaks regularly with his counterpart in Moscow.

United States military officials said on Thursday that in the airstrike, American warplanes hit a convoy of pro-government militia forces because it was approaching a base where American and British special operations troops train Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State. The officials said the convoy ignored a warning strike.

For its part, the Syrian government said the United States had no right to defend the base, which was established in Syria without government permission, or to declare areas off limits to pro-government forces.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday that the convoy included some Iranian-backed militia forces. But Pentagon officials said it was too soon to say whether Iran had directed the convoy to attack the rebel training base, which is near the border with Jordan.

The airstrike came against the backdrop of a broader geopolitical contest to take control of areas of eastern Syria held by the Islamic State, as well as of the highway from Damascus to Baghdad, which passes through the area where the strike took place.

Two competing coalitions -- backed by air power from the United States in one case and from Russia in the other -- are racing to the same goal, creating a potentially volatile situation and increasing the likelihood of clashes like the one on Thursday.

SANA, the Syrian state news agency, said the strike unmasked ''fake claims'' by the Americans that they were fighting terrorism, adding that anyone claiming to be fighting the Islamic State and Al Qaeda should ''direct strikes against them'' and not against Syrian and allied forces.

Video posted online showed what was described as the aftermath of the attack. Voices speaking with an Iraqi accent in Arabic bolstered accounts that Iraqi militias -- many of which have fought on the Syrian government side with Iranian support -- had been hit.

A day before the attack, Iraq's national security adviser, Faleh al-Fayed, who acts as a go-between for Iran and the United States on the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq, had visited President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in Damascus to reaffirm Iraqi and Syrian government cooperation against the extremist group.

The militia Sayyid al-Shuhada, or Master of Martyrs, said in a statement that the United States had forgotten the role played by the resistance in Iraq during the war there and accused American forces of interfering in their fight against the Islamic State.

''Targeting our presence in Syria is targeting us in Iraq, too, and we will strike the enemy and its supporters everywhere,'' the statement said.

The recriminations came as the latest round of talks in Geneva on the Syria crisis wrapped up with the parties having barely touched on the four ''baskets'' of issues that were scheduled to be discussed.

Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations mediator, told reporters that he saw ''less rhetoric, a more businesslike atmosphere'' in the talks, but little, if any, progress. He said he hoped to bring the Syrian parties back to Geneva for another round sometime in June.

Russia's Middle East envoy, Mikhail Bogdanov, complained on Friday about the approach taken by the United States, calling it contradictory.

''The impression that the new administration gives is that it does not have any tactics, nor more importantly does it have any strategy,'' he told reporters in Russia. ''It apparently searches for any way of solving problems, as it thinks, and maybe it is not very interested in some problems at all.''

Although the United States has covertly aided some Syrian rebels fighting Mr. Assad, it has directly struck pro-government forces only twice before -- in 2016 in what it called an accident, and this year in retaliation for chemical attacks it blamed on Mr. Assad's forces.

The area where the convoy was struck is strategically important to the United States, which wants to stabilize Iraq -- where it has a long-term military and political investment -- and to Russia, which wants to strengthen the Syrian government's control of as much territory as possible.

The area is also critical to Iran, which wants secure corridors from its borders to the Mediterranean in order to reinforce its influence in Lebanon and to maintain an ability to challenge Israel.

Mr. Trump's Paradoxical Journey

No American president in modern times has disparaged Islam as much as Donald Trump. From the attempted visa ban on Muslim-majority countries to his campaign claims that ''Islam hates us'' to his Islamaphobic advisers, the president's record of hostility is well documented.

So his first overseas trip as president is something of a paradox, with a first stop in Saudi Arabia -- a major force in the Sunni Arab world --- that includes meetings with members of the royal family, a summit meeting with other Arab leaders and a major speech on Sunday.

Does that mean Mr. Trump has changed his stripes? Given his casual approach to the truth and his malleable belief system, it's impossible to know his true views on Islam. What we do know is that he needs all the help he can get from Muslim countries to fight the Islamic State. If he uses the speech and the trip to set a new tone with the Muslim world, that would be greatly in America's interest.

The Saudis, who came to loathe President Barack Obama, are falling over themselves to turn the page. Mr. Trump's decision to visit Saudi Arabia ''lays to rest the notion that America is anti-Muslim,'' the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told reporters early this month, ignoring the fact that the real issue is not whether America is anti-Muslim but whether Mr. Trump is. It was he, after all, who stoked xenophobic fires to win the election.

Mr. Obama worked hard to cultivate the Saudi-American relationship, selling the kingdom $115 billion in arms, providing support in the Saudi war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, pushing Israeli-Palestian peace negotiations and making Riyadh his first stop in the Arab world.

But the Saudis never forgave him for endorsing the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt; for refusing to intervene directly in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad; and for negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran, its Shiite enemy, even though the deal made the region safer.

The Saudis and Mr. Trump appear eager to do business and to forge an alliance against Iran. Saudi Arabia has committed to shifting its economy from its dependence on oil and wants American investment to speed that process, while Mr. Trump's decision to sell the kingdom an additional $110 billion in weapons provides more business for American companies. This is excessive; in exchange, the Saudis should be asked to make a more serious commitment to regional peace, including a political settlement in Yemen.

Along with other Sunni Arab countries, Saudi Arabia is obsessed with Iran, which is unquestionably playing a troubling and mischievous role in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, and the Saudis are pleased with Mr. Trump's anti-Iran line. But focusing only on Iran ignores the destabilizing activities of Saudi Arabia in Yemen, where Saudi bombs have killed untold numbers of civilians. It also ignores the fact that Saudi Arabia's conservative brand of Islam has done much to inspire ISIS and other extremists.

Mr. Obama tried to forge a more neutral path, engaging Iran on the nuclear deal and admonishing the Saudis to find a way to live with Iran. There is speculation that the Sunni Arabs and Israel might cooperate in a regional security arrangement. This could be constructive, but not if its only purpose is to ostracize Iran.

With Mr. Trump embattled at home, there's a real danger that in his eagerness for a successful visit he will agree to almost anything his hosts desire, like more American involvement in proxy wars against Iran in Yemen and Syria. Also, he has shown little interest in human rights and in pressing authoritarian countries to treat their people -- especially women, in Saudi Arabia's case -- with respect.

This trip is Mr. Trump's first chance to act as a global statesman. He will define that role not by accommodating Arab demands but by pursuing a strategy that advances America's security interests as well as those of its partners.

Mattis Says Escalation Against  ISIS  Doesn’ Imperil More Civilians

WASHINGTON —he United States began accelerating and intensifying its campaign against the Islamic State in January, at President Trump’ direction, but it was not putting civilians in war zones at greater risk, the defense secretary said Friday.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Mr. Trump’ decision to delegate more authority to commanders had put greater pressure on militants in Syria, Yemen and Somalia. And he said a tactical shift to surround Islamic State strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, was devised not only to “nnihilate”housands of fighters hunkered down there, but also to prevent them from returning to their home nations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, possibly to commit mayhem in those places.

In an hourlong news conference at the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis took issue with human rights groups and other critics who have warned that the military’ new authorities freeing them from Obama-era constraints on airstrikes and raids against insurgents in Yemen and Somalia have jeopardized the safety of civilians in those countries.

“ want to emphasize here there has been no change to our rules of engagement, and there has been no change to our continued extraordinary efforts to avoid innocent civilian casualties,”r. Mattis told reporters.

Amid a generally upbeat assessment of the campaign against the Islamic State —nown internally now as “-\b ISIS\b0 ”or “efeat ISIS,”sing another name for the group —r. Mattis struck a sobering note, saying the fight “s not going to be over soon.”

Mr. Mattis was joined by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Brett McGurk, the United States special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State.

The timing of their comments, which represent the most comprehensive report on the Trump administration’ campaign against the Islamic State, was not happenstance: It came as Mr. Trump headed out on a nine-day visit to Saudi Arabia and Europe, where he will not only seek to rally support for the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but also try to gain commitments from NATO for more troops in Afghanistan.

Mr. Trump seemed pleased enough with his top generals on Friday to renominate General Dunford and Gen. Paul J. Selva of the Air Force, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each to a second two-year term in their jobs.

At the Pentagon, General Dunford ticked off some of the campaign’ accomplishments, including reclaiming 55 percent of the territory the Islamic State has seized in Syria and Iraq since 2014. He said the effort has also significantly reduced the group’ ability to finance its terrorist operations and draw new recruits into Iraq and Syria, down to fewer than 100 a month from a peak of 1,500 a month.

Other senior American officials, including Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, have offered a more measured analysis of the impact of the global fight. Mr. Rasmussen said this month that “he global reach of ISIS remains largely intact”espite the group’ territorial losses.

American officials now believe that about 40,000 prospective fighters from more than 120 countries have traveled to, or tried to travel to, the war zones in Iraq and Syria since 2014.

In explaining the Trump administration’ strangle-the-stronghold strategy, Mr. Mattis underscored a looming menace: “he foreign fighters are the strategic threat should they return home to Tunis, to Kuala Lumpur, to Paris, to Detroit, wherever.”

But it is not at all clear that the Obama administration’ strategy, which General Dunford himself shaped and Mr. McGurk defended, was to let Islamic State fighters escape to fight another day. American military officers have also said it was the Iraqis’dea —ot the Americans’—o send the Iraqi Army west of Mosul to cut off the city.

The Pentagon officials on Friday cited examples of the accelerated fight against the Islamic State.

After months of debate, beginning under President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump last week approved a plan to arm Syrian Kurds so they can help in the battle to retake Raqqa from the Islamic State, a strategy that has drawn deep opposition from Turkey, a NATO ally.

American military commanders have long contended that arming the Y.P.G., a Kurdish militia fighting alongside Syrian Arab forces against the Islamic State, is the fastest way to seize Raqqa, the capital of the militants’elf-proclaimed caliphate.

Turkey has objected strongly to arming the Kurds, raising fears that Ankara could curtail cooperation with Washington in the continued battle.

General Dunford said Friday that the United States had already stockpiled weapons and equipment —hich other officials said could include heavy machine guns, mortars, anti-tank weapons, armored cars and engineering equipment —nd would begin distributing them soon to Kurdish and Arab fighters in the anti-Islamic State coalition.

General Dunford highlighted the recent decision to allow American military advisers to accompany Iraqi troops down to the battalion level, particularly in operations in Mosul, although it is unclear how often that happens. The Americans’roximity to Iraqi forces in the complex urban terrain allows them to provide better support.

Mr. Trump’ top advisers are also recommending sending 3,000 to 5,000 additional American troops to try to break a stalemate in the 15-year war in Afghanistan. That final decision, Mr. Mattis said, is still pending.

American forces now have broader authorities to combat militants in parts of Somalia and Yemen. But General Dunford cited a recent mission in Syria as a less recognized illustration of the latitude the Trump administration has given its commanders to carry out operations without prolonged review in Washington: an effort to take control of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River near Lake Assad, the nearby town of Tabqa and a local airfield.

With Mr. Mattis suggesting that the fight against the Islamic State would still take years, not months, to complete, he was asked what success would look like.

“ou’e got to drive them down to a point that police can handle it,”r. Mattis said. “olice can’ handle a force that’ driving tanks and using artillery, or has thousands of fighters in mobile vehicles that allow them to range far and wide.”

A visit holds hope of new peace talks

JERUSALEM -- President Trump leaves for the Middle East on Friday. The trip's objectives, his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, has told reporters, is to ''broadcast a message of unity to America's friends'' and to pay his respects to the ''homelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths.''

Mr. Trump will begin in Saudi Arabia, with which his administration is nearing consummation of a $100 billion arms deal; he'll meet with leaders of the Arab League -- America's ''partners,'' as General McMaster says -- whom he'll encourage ''to take bold, new steps to promote peace and to confront those, from ISIS to Al Qaeda to Iran to the Assad regime, who perpetuate chaos.'' In Jerusalem, Mr. Trump will ''reaffirm America's unshakable bond to the Jewish state'' and in Bethlehem, ''express his desire for dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians.'' American leadership is necessary to ''move the region toward the peace, security and stability that the people there so deserve,'' General McMaster said.

Let's strain to ignore the latest reasons to question Mr. Trump's fitness for office or, indeed, his survivability in it: the firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director, the intelligence leak to Russia. General McMaster has laid out the policy lines of a Republican administration that is just beginning its four-year term.

To be sure, the approach has been enigmatic so far. But that may be an advantage, since progress toward those goals does not depend on the president alone. Among Trump advisers like General McMaster, a refreshed realists' view of the Middle East seems to be unfolding. Impeach Mr. Trump and you get Mike Pence , who was instrumental in replacing Michael Flynn with General McMaster and was the lead adviser in appointing Jim Mattis as secretary of defense and Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.

Just before the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas , visited Washington in early May, General McMaster said at the Israeli Embassy that the administration ''seeks to challenge failed policies of the past with a businessman's results-oriented approach.''

The question is, what results would General McMaster want, and for whom?

The answer, while still emerging, has changed since before Mr. Trump took office. Then, he and the Republican leadership seemed determined to bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. They mocked the United Nations Security Council 's condemnation of settlements and promised to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem. And within days of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the State Department froze the last payment to the Palestinian Authority authorized by President Barack Obama .

Mr. Trump appointed his son-in-law, Jared Kushner , and his corporate lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, both with pro-Zionist sympathies, to handle negotiations. Mr. Pence said at an American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in March that ''every freedom-loving American stands with Israel, because her cause is our cause.''

But if the presidency has not weakened Mr. Trump's affinity for Mr. Netanyahu, it has at least exposed the administration to countervailing pressures, especially from vulnerable Arab leaders who want America to think differently about the Palestinian question. King Abdullah II of Jordan and the Saudi deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, have often stressed that violence in Palestine threatens the stability of America's Arab allies. They have argued for a military alliance against Iranian mischief, including insurgencies in Yemen and Bahrain. They've affirmed the Arab Peace Initiative of 2003, which promised normalization of relations with Israel if the question of Palestine were resolved.

Mr. Netanyahu has suggested that Israel should be included in such an alliance -- that normalization should precede a deal, and might even advance it. In late March, at a meeting of the Arab League in Jordan, King Abdullah scotched that notion. Mr. Trump met Abdullah just after the meeting, and the king praised the president for his ''holistic approach to all the challenges in the region.'' He also insisted that Palestine ''is the core conflict for a lot of us in the region'' and that ''the president knows this.''

The people around Mr. Trump obviously do. General McMaster's phrase, ''dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians,'' was borrowed from Mr. Abbas. At the Aipac conference, Mr. Pence added that the administration was ''also invested in finding an equitable and just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.'' On ''Meet the Press,'' Secretary Tillerson denied that an embassy move could be separate from an overall peace initiative.

As for Mr. Mattis, his views have hardly been hidden. ''I paid a military security price every day as the commander of Centcom because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel,'' he said in 2013, adding that ''moderate Arabs who want to be with us'' could not ''come out publicly in support of people who don't show respect for the Arab Palestinians.'' Foreign Policy magazine reported, meanwhile, that the State Department is discreetly proposing a 5 percent raise in aid to the Palestinian Authority , to $215 million.

In advance of his trip, Mr. Trump has seemed uncharacteristically disciplined in the balancing act he's expected to perform. An agreement, he told reporters in Mr. Abbas's presence, ''cannot be imposed by the United States, or by any other nation.'' That reaffirmed a longstanding Netanyahu position and implied that Mr. Abbas should negotiate without preconditions and without an assurance that the United States would pressure Israel. But then Mr. Trump added, ''I will do whatever is necessary to facilitate the agreement -- to mediate, to arbitrate anything they'd like to do.'' The next day, General McMaster appointed to his national security team Air Force Col. Kris Bauman, who had proposed security arrangements for both sides in 2013.

Mr. Abbas must find President Trump's inconsistency and reversion to mogul banalities a relief. His people reportedly proposed to Mr. Trump's people, businesslike, that new talks with Israel could start where Mr. Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu's predecessor, Ehud Olmert, broke off in 2008, having covered most major issues -- security, borders, Jerusalem and refugees -- and leaving potentially bridgeable gaps. Nor did Mr. Abbas miss the chance for some tactical flattery, telling Mr. Trump that with his ''great negotiating ability,'' peace was possible.

Mr. Netanyahu cannot feel equally sanguine. Many have questioned whether Mr. Abbas can survive a new round of peacemaking. Mr. Netanyahu may be wondering whether the administration is inadvertently threatening his fragile coalition. And Mr. Abbas made clear to Mr. Olmert that any Palestinian conception of two states entailed a capital in East Jerusalem and international arrangements for the Holy Basin.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Saudis and the Emiratis have been discussing an interim plan ''aimed in part at aligning them with Mr. Trump'' that would establish direct telecommunications links with Israel, allow overflight rights to Israeli aircraft and lift restrictions on some trade -- but only if Israel froze settlements outside the large blocks along the Green Line and eased Gaza's commercial quarantine. Any of these concessions would cause hard-line ministers on the Israeli right to bolt, though they are acceptable to Netanyahu's rivals in the opposition.

Mr. Netanyahu, to be sure, still has powerful Republican allies like Senator Lindsey Graham and the casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson . And Mr. Trump has not encountered them pushing back -- yet.

But one thing is clear. The administration is operating from an emerging logic that could well appeal to many more Republicans and a great many Democrats as well. President Trump has said he wants the ''ultimate deal,'' and the people around him -- who may well outlast him -- do, too.

Back Story

From Lawfare: Reporters only get to print a fraction of what they are told, given constraints of space, time and relevancy. In this post from Lawfare, a much-read legal affairs blog, its editor gives a riveting first-person account of what, how and why he told a Times reporter this week about his conversations with James Comey about Donald Trump, information that produced a front-page scoop. —ichael Wines, national correspondent

_____

Simply Devastating

From Time: Russia may have found a way to alter the course of real-life events by manipulating public opinion through phishing, fake news and social media propaganda. What’ fascinating is that these tactics are not technically advanced —isinformation tactics were used in the Cold War —ut the use of computing power to segment and target millions of people at once is forcing security experts to rethink their defensive measures. A great read for anyone who enjoys a good spy tale. —una Sandvik, director of information security, newsroom

_____

E Pluribus, Pluribus

From The New York Times: What a week for news and for columnists from across the internet (and across ideologies) reacting to that news. First, read about how the right, left and center reacted to James Comey’ memo about his meetings with President Trump here. When you’e done with that, check out how political writers responded to the announcement of Robert Mueller III as special counsel, and Vice President Pence’ role on the transition team and in the administration. —nna Dubenko, senior digital strategist

_____

Blasted From the Past

From The Atlantic: Graeme Wood is particularly gifted at explaining abhorrent ideas; his 2015 story on \b ISIS\b0  remains a useful resource for understanding the group’ theology and ideology. And the fact that he went to high school with Richard Spencer, the young godfather of the “lt-right,”lso solves a problem that a lot of editors and journalists have faced in dealing with Mr. Spencer and his ideas —amely whether we really should dignify them with extensive consideration, given that it’ unclear how many Americans really subscribe to them. Mr. Wood’ personal connection with Mr. Spencer lets him interrogate Mr. Spencer’ ideas at length without overhyping their influence. —ill Wasik, deputy editor, New York Times Magazine

_____

Framing the Debate

From The Ringer: More and more, politics and political conversations seem to be happening concurrently, as if in parallel universes. This piece sums it up with this thought: “e’e all definitely arguing, but if we’e not arguing competing points in the same conversation …s it even an argument?”—rashant Rao, deputy Europe business editor

_____

Walking It Back

From The Economist: It’ a time-honored form of apology: “ misspoke.”ut it also often serves as a diversion tactic, one that confuses a “ypo”a casual error of speech or transcription) with a “hinko”a substantive mistake that betrays legitimate ignorance). —tephen Hiltner, Staff Editor, Times Insider

_____

Man and Myth

From The New Yorker: J.F.K. would be 100 this year, and Thomas Mallon writes a moving, quirky memory piece about a president who still drives so many imaginations. Another benefit: He discusses a new book on Kennedy by two wonderful former colleagues of mine at The Boston Globe: Curtis Wilkie and Thomas Oliphant. —teven Erlanger, London bureau chief

_____

What the Bullet Took

From The Washington Post: A beautifully written, heartbreaking column about a man left paralyzed by a bullet in his back and his death weeks later, just as he was starting to have hope for the future again. —ernanda Santos, Phoenix Bureau chief

_____

Company Towns

From New York Magazine: This is a tale of two Ford towns, one gearing up for good times after Trump browbeat the company into adding hundreds of jobs there, the other enduring a 50 percent cut in tax revenues and ending municipal retiree health benefits after layoffs of an almost equal number. Along the way it has a lot to say about how the physical work of automaking has changed, and how tenuous the future feels in both places. —evin McKenna, deputy business editor

Something Completely Different

From The Awl: Sometimes, the perfect antidote to news fatigue is to read about your favorite mid-90s power ballad before watching the music video nine times in a row. —ichael Gold, social media strategy editor

Russia and Syria Denounce U.S. Airstrike on Pro-Assad Militia

BEIRUT, Lebanon —ussian and Syrian officials on Friday strongly condemned an American airstrike on pro-Syrian government forces in southern Syria a day earlier, calling it an act of aggression and rejecting the United States’ustification for the attack.

“t is illegitimate, it is unlawful and the latest gross violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic,”Russia’ foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said in Cyprus, according to the state-run Russian news agency Tass.

After the airstrike, which American officials said was defensive in nature, Pentagon officials said on Friday that they were working with Russia to prevent similar ground incidents in the future, much as the two countries have done for months to avoid accidents in the skies over Syria.

“e had a proposal that we’e working on with the Russians right now,”en. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Friday, declining to give details. “y sense is that the Russians are as enthusiastic as we are to deconflict operations and ensure that we can continue to take the campaign to \b ISIS\b0  and ensure the safety of our personnel.”

General Dunford said that “he ground is becoming increasingly complex and constrained”n Syria, as Russian-backed pro-government forces advance closer to Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIS-held territory in Syria, and are already fighting in cities to the south like Deir Azzour.

The general said that, in addition to a communications channel between Russian officers in Syria and American officers in Qatar that is used to prevent midair collisions, another channel has been opened in which a three-star general in Washington now speaks regularly with his counterpart in Moscow.

United States military officials said on Thursday that in the airstrike, American warplanes hit a convoy of pro-government militia forces because it was approaching a base where American and British special operations troops train Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State. The officials said the convoy ignored a warning strike.

For its part, the Syrian government said the United States had no right to defend the base, which was established in Syria without government permission, or to declare areas off limits to pro-government forces.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday that the convoy included some Iranian-backed militia forces. But Pentagon officials said it was too soon to say whether Iran had directed the convoy to attack the rebel training base, which is near the border with Jordan.

The airstrike came against the backdrop of a broader geopolitical contest to take control of areas of eastern Syria held by the Islamic State, as well as of the highway from Damascus to Baghdad, which passes through the area where the strike took place.

Two competing coalitions —acked by air power from the United States in one case and from Russia in the other —re racing to the same goal, creating a potentially volatile situation and increasing the likelihood of clashes like the one on Thursday.

SANA, the Syrian state news agency, said the strike unmasked “ake claims”y the Americans that they were fighting terrorism, adding that anyone claiming to be fighting the Islamic State and Al Qaeda should “irect strikes against them”nd not against Syrian and allied forces.

Video posted online showed what was described as the aftermath of the attack. Voices speaking with an Iraqi accent in Arabic bolstered accounts that Iraqi militias —any of which have fought on the Syrian government side with Iranian support —ad been hit.

A day before the attack, Iraq’ national security adviser, Faleh al-Fayed, who acts as a go-between for Iran and the United States on the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq, had visited President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in Damascus to reaffirm Iraqi and Syrian government cooperation against the extremist group.

The militia Sayyid al-Shuhada, or Master of Martyrs, said in a statement that the United States had forgotten the role played by the resistance in Iraq during the war there and accused American forces of interfering in their fight against Islamic State.

“argeting our presence in Syria is targeting us in Iraq, too, and we will strike the enemy and its supporters everywhere,”he statement said.

The recriminations came as the latest round of talks in Geneva on the Syria crisis wrapped up with the parties having barely touched on the four “askets”f issues that were scheduled to be discussed.

Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations mediator, told reporters that he saw “ess rhetoric, a more businesslike atmosphere”n the talks, but little, if any, progress. He said he hoped to bring the Syrian parties back to Geneva for another round sometime in June.

Russia’ Middle East envoy, Mikhail Bogdanov, complained on Friday about the approach taken by the United States, calling it contradictory.

“he impression that the new administration gives is that it does not have any tactics, nor more importantly does it have any strategy,”e told reporters in Russia. “t apparently searches for any way of solving problems, as it thinks, and maybe it is not very interested in some problems at all.”

Although the United States has covertly aided some Syrian rebels fighting Mr. Assad, it has directly struck pro-government forces only twice before —n 2016 in what it called an accident, and this year in retaliation for chemical attacks it blamed on Mr. Assad’ forces.

The area where the convoy was struck is strategically important to the United States, which wants to stabilize Iraq —here it has a long-term military and political investment —nd to Russia, which wants to strengthen the Syrian government’ control of as much territory as possible.

The area is also critical to Iran, which wants secure corridors from its borders to the Mediterranean in order to reinforce its influence in Lebanon and to maintain an ability to challenge Israel.

Defiant Trump Deems Inquiry 'A Witch Hunt'

WASHINGTON -- President Trump declared angrily on Thursday that he was the victim of a witch hunt, and all but contradicted his deputy attorney general on the firing of the F.B.I. director, in an extensive denial of any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Mr. Trump used a chaotic White House news conference with Colombia's leader to directly confront a weeklong barrage of criticism and questions in a political storm that he said was dividing the nation. He also conspicuously distanced himself from aides like his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in repeating his claim that Moscow and its agents had not secretly assisted his campaign.

''I respect the move,'' Mr. Trump said of the Justice Department's decision on Wednesday to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter. ''But the entire thing has been a witch hunt.''

''And there is no collusion between, certainly, myself and my campaign -- but I can always speak for myself -- and the Russians,'' he said. ''Zero.''

Mr. Trump made his comments while standing alongside Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos. As he dug in his heels, Mr. Trump further muddied his explanation of why he dismissed the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey -- and in doing so, offered a different version of events from one given to senators just hours earlier by the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.

In that meeting, Mr. Rosenstein outlined his decision to appoint Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel. Several senators emerged afterward to say Mr. Rosenstein had told them he was certain that the president was going to dismiss Mr. Comey, even before he wrote a memo critical of the director's performance.

But at his news conference, Mr. Trump reverted to the White House's original claim that he was primarily responding to Mr. Rosenstein's recommendation to dismiss Mr. Comey. The president had later claimed that he had moved against Mr. Comey in part because of his frustration over the F.B.I.'s handling of the Russia investigation.

''Director Comey was very unpopular with most people,'' Mr. Trump said on Thursday. ''When I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision. Because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side, not only the Republican side, that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.''

There was a palpable sense among the senators who filed out of the briefing room that the center of gravity in the investigation was shifting from Capitol Hill to Mr. Mueller, who will spend weeks assembling a staff and a list of witnesses to interview.

''This pretty much shuts Congress down,'' Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters. ''Democrats, you got what you wanted. You got a special counsel. Now we'll just move on. We're not prosecutors.''

The prospect of Mr. Mueller, a former federal prosecutor with a reputation for moral rectitude and an exacting management style, opening a wide-ranging investigation further rattled a demoralized White House staff, only a day before Mr. Trump was scheduled to depart on a grueling nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. Several of Mr. Trump's advisers and associates have urged him to hire an experienced outside lawyer to help him deal with the surging controversy over whether his campaign had ties to Russia, according to several people briefed on the conversations.

Mr. Trump began the day in a defiant mood, abandoning the conciliatory tone the White House had shown in a statement Wednesday evening. In an early-morning Twitter post, he cited, without evidence, ''illegal acts'' committed by the administration of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, and the campaign of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton -- and said they had never led to a special counsel.

''With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!'' Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, initially misspelling counsel.

Moments later, he added, ''This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!''

The president was correct in his observation about the rarity of a special counsel, though his references to the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration did little to bolster his case. There were multiple congressional investigations into the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the role played by Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, and Mr. Obama.

It was not the first time Mr. Trump likened the questions about his campaign and Russia to a witch hunt. In January, while president-elect, he said in an interview with The New York Times that the persistent focus on Russia's hacking of the American presidential campaign was a witch hunt carried out by people bitter at his victory.

The president elaborated on that theme in the news conference, casting the investigation as a needless distraction from the achievements of his administration, which he enthusiastically enumerated.

''We've had tremendous success,'' he said. ''You look at our job numbers. You look at what's going on at the border.''

Some of Mr. Trump's claims raised more questions than answers. ''You're going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation,'' he said, referring to the defense secretary, Jim Mattis. ''The numbers are staggering, how successful they've been.''

He promised to name a new F.B.I. director soon, having acknowledged to reporters earlier in the day that former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was a top contender.

Mr. Trump's sense of grievance over the Russia investigations had been deepening even before the naming of a special counsel. On Thursday, he arrived in the East Room primed for confrontation.

Rather than call on a reporter from a conservative-leaning news organization, as he has in the past, Mr. Trump pointed to Jonathan Karl, an ABC News correspondent known for his close questioning during White House briefings.

When a second reporter, Scott Thuman of the broadcaster Sinclair, asked Mr. Trump whether he had urged Mr. Comey to drop the Russia investigation, Mr. Thuman could not finish the question before the president interrupted. ''No. No,'' Mr. Trump snapped. ''Next question.''

Mr. Santos, a Harvard-trained economist who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for negotiating a peace treaty with the FARC guerrillas, watched the spectacle with an inscrutable expression. After he sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with the White House plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt the flow of drugs into the United States, Mr. Trump jumped in.

''That was a very long and very diplomatic answer,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I will say it a bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel.''

Earlier, Mr. Trump said that coca cultivation and cocaine production had risen to record levels in Colombia, and challenged Mr. Santos to remedy the problem.

Mr. Santos returned the favor minutes later when asked whether he had advice for Mr. Trump.

''I don't think I'm in a position to give any advice to President Trump,'' Mr. Santos said with a smile. ''He can take care of himself.''

Hell on Earth: The Fall of Syria and the Rise of  ISIS

Advances in image-making technology -- not just digital capture and storage, but ever-shrinking lenses and sensors -- have brought new dimensions to the depiction of reality. ''Hell on Earth: The Fall of Syria and the Rise of ISIS,'' directed by the intrepid journalist Sebastian Junger and the documentarian Nick Quested, contains imagery that was unimaginable not too many years ago.

When I say ''unimaginable,'' I'm not just talking about tech issues. The directors include footage recorded through a device in a motorcycle helmet worn by Mohammed Merah when he killed seven people in southwestern France in 2012. (The actual murders are omitted, but we see the aftermath.) The directors also show videos of the beheadings of several Western captives by masked Islamic State killers; these propaganda videos were noteworthy not just for what they showed, but also for their professional polish. Footage of two Syrian family men, identified only as Marwan and Radwan, who are trying to get themselves and their loved ones out of the country, had to be shot in secret, and looks it.

The movie also tries to explain the causes of what's happening in Syria, and its repercussions. Flawed United States policies get a thorough airing; by the same token, you are left to wonder what could possibly represent a ''winning'' policy here. In his narration, Mr. Junger compares the situation to a bar fight, ''where everyone jumps in and is throwing chairs at each other.'' He adds that in a proxy war, no one gets out clean.

A mostly impressive array of experts (including, in the movie's one unfortunate off note, Michael T. Flynn, who was forced to resign as national security adviser) adds to the merciless clarity of this tragic picture.

Rated R for graphic imagery. In English, French, Arabic and Kurdish, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes.

Mr. Erdogan Does Not Get His Way

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey came to Washington for his first meeting with President Trump with hopes of achieving a ''turning point'' in an alliance that is vitally important to both sides, but has been profoundly strained by policy issues involving efforts to defeat ISIS in Syria. His demands were mostly unreasonable, which means continued tensions.

The enduring image of Mr. Erdogan's visit will not be the pomp at the White House but that of his security guards and other supporters beating up protesters outside the Turkish ambassador's residence. The police described the attack as ''brutal'' and the State Department called it an intolerable assault on free speech. Eleven people were injured, including a police officer, and nine were taken to the hospital. Some Republican lawmakers said Turkey should apologize.

The Turkish Embassy blamed the demonstrators for ''aggressively provoking Turkish-American citizens who had peacefully assembled to greet'' Mr. Erdogan. Washington's Metropolitan Police will now have to determine accountability. That could be tricky; Mr. Erdogan and his security people are back in Turkey. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has shown a shocking indifference to Mr. Erdogan's authoritarian crackdown on his own people, which in turn makes it even more important to show that the United States will follow the rule of law.

As for policy issues, Mr. Erdogan demanded, among other things, that the United States abandon the Syrian Kurds, whom he views as terrorists. But Mr. Trump had already approved a plan to arm Syrian Kurds so that they can help in the campaign to take Raqqa, the capital of ISIS' self-declared caliphate. Mr. Erdogan considers the Syrian Kurds to be indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers' Party or P.K.K., a separatist group fighting his government in Turkey. For their part, American military commanders have long argued that the Kurds are among the most skilled fighters in the region and must be part of the ground force if Raqqa is to be recaptured anytime soon.

Mr. Erdogan may have thought he could sweet-talk the mercurial Mr. Trump into changing this policy; indeed, some senior American officials feared that this could happen, given Mr. Trump's fondness for strongmen and the suspicious ties of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to Turkey. But Mr. Trump correctly stuck with his decision to reinforce the Syrian Kurds.

The Syrian Kurds have already carved out a Kurdish zone in Syria along Turkey's southern border; Turkey fears that their enlarged role in the battle for Raqqa could enable them to extend the zone and funnel arms to the P.K.K. To mitigate Turkish concerns, the Pentagon has recruited more local Arabs, who could make up 80 percent of the ground force of 50,000 or so troops that will seek to retake Raqqa.

Mr. Erdogan also hoped he could persuade the administration to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania who Turkey believes was the mastermind behind an aborted coup last July. The administration appears not to have given in to this demand. There is a strict judicial process that must be followed before such a decision is made, and so far, Turkey has not provided the evidence needed to support an extradition claim, officials say.

Reflecting its unhappiness with the visit, Turkey called for Brett McGurk, the American coordinator for the anti-ISIS coalition, to be replaced (the State Department says he will remain), and threatened to strike back ''without asking anyone'' if it comes under attack by the Syrian Kurds. The hoped-for ''turning point'' seems a long way away.

JERUSALEM —resident Trump leaves for the Middle East on Friday. The trip’ objectives, his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, has told reporters, is to “roadcast a message of unity to America’ friends”nd to pay his respects to the “omelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths.”

Mr. Trump will begin in Saudi Arabia, with which his administration is nearing consummation   of a $100 billion arms deal; he’l meet with leaders of the Arab League —merica’ “artners,”s General McMaster says —hom he’l encourage “o take bold, new steps to promote peace and to confront those, from ISIS to Al Qaeda to Iran to the Assad regime, who perpetuate chaos.”n Jerusalem, Mr. Trump will “eaffirm America’ unshakable bond to the Jewish state”nd in Bethlehem, “xpress his desire for dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians  .”merican leadership is necessary to “ove the region toward the peace, security and stability that the people there so deserve,”eneral McMaster said.

Let’ strain to ignore the latest reasons to question Mr. Trump’ fitness for office or, indeed, his survivability in it: the firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director, the intelligence leak to Russia. General McMaster has laid out the policy lines of a Republican administration that is just beginning its four-year term.

To be sure, the approach has been enigmatic so far. But that may be an advantage, since progress toward those goals does not depend on the president alone. Among Trump advisers like General McMaster, a refreshed realists’iew of the Middle East seems to be unfolding. Impeach Mr. Trump and you get Mike Pence , who was instrumental in replacing Michael Flynn with General McMaster and was the lead adviser in appointing Jim Mattis as secretary of defense and Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.

Just before the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas , visited Washington in early May, General McMaster said at the Israeli Embassy that the administration “eeks to challenge failed policies of the past with a businessman’ results-oriented approach.”

The question is, what results would General McMaster want, and for whom?

The answer, while still emerging, has changed since before Mr. Trump took office. Then, he and the Republican leadership seemed determined to bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  . They mocked the United Nations Security Council ’ condemnation of settlements and promised to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem. And within days of Mr. Trump’ inauguration, the State Department froze the last payment to the Palestinian Authority authorized by President Barack Obama .

Mr. Trump appointed his son-in-law, Jared Kushner , and his corporate lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, both with pro-Zionist sympathies, to handle negotiations. Mr. Pence said at an American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in March that “very freedom-loving American stands with Israel, because her cause is our cause.”

But if the presidency has not weakened Mr. Trump’ affinity for Mr. Netanyahu, it has at least exposed the administration to countervailing pressures, especially from vulnerable Arab leaders who want America to think differently about the Palestinian question. King Abdullah II of Jordan and the Saudi deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, have often stressed that violence in Palestine threatens the stability of America’ Arab allies. They have argued for a military alliance against Iranian mischief, including insurgencies in Yemen and Bahrain. They’e affirmed the Arab Peace Initiative of 2003  , which promised normalization of relations with Israel if the question of Palestine were resolved.

Mr. Netanyahu has suggested   that Israel should be included in such an alliance —hat normalization should precede a deal, and might even advance it. In late March, at a meeting of the Arab League in Jordan, King Abdullah scotched   that notion. Mr. Trump met Abdullah just after the meeting, and the king praised the president for his “olistic approach to all the challenges in the region.”e also insisted that Palestine “s the core conflict for a lot of us in the region”nd that “he president knows this.”

The people around Mr. Trump obviously do. General McMaster’ phrase, “ignity and self-determination for the Palestinians,”as borrowed from Mr. Abbas. At the Aipac conference, Mr. Pence added that the administration was “lso invested in finding an equitable and just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”n “eet the Press,”ecretary Tillerson denied that an embassy move could be separate from an overall peace initiative.

As for Mr. Mattis, his views have hardly been hidden. “ paid a military security price every day as the commander of Centcom because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel,”e said in 2013, adding that “oderate Arabs who want to be with us”ould not “ome out publicly in support of people who don’ show respect for the Arab Palestinians.”oreign Policy magazine reported, meanwhile, that the State Department is discreetly proposing a 5 percent raise in aid to the Palestinian Authority , to $215 million.

In advance of his trip, Mr. Trump has seemed uncharacteristically disciplined in the balancing act he’ expected to perform. An agreement, he told reporters in Mr. Abbas’ presence, “annot be imposed by the United States, or by any other nation.”hat reaffirmed a longstanding Netanyahu position and implied that Mr. Abbas should negotiate without preconditions and without an assurance that the United States would pressure Israel. But then Mr. Trump added, “ will do whatever is necessary to facilitate the agreement —o mediate, to arbitrate anything they’ like to do.”he next day, General McMaster appointed to his national security team Air Force Col. Kris Bauman, who had proposed security arrangements for both sides in 2013.

Mr. Abbas must find President Trump’ inconsistency and reversion to mogul banalities a relief. His people reportedly   proposed to Mr. Trump’ people, businesslike, that new talks with Israel could start where Mr. Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu’ predecessor, Ehud Olmert, broke off in 2008, having covered most major issues —ecurity, borders, Jerusalem and refugees —nd leaving potentially bridgeable gaps. Nor did Mr. Abbas miss the chance for some tactical flattery, telling Mr. Trump that with his “reat negotiating ability,”eace was possible.

Mr. Netanyahu cannot feel equally sanguine. Many have questioned whether Mr. Abbas can survive a new round of peacemaking. Mr. Netanyahu may be wondering whether the administration is inadvertently threatening his fragile coalition  . And Mr. Abbas made clear to Mr. Olmert that any Palestinian conception of two states entailed a capital in East Jerusalem and international arrangements for the Holy Basin.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Saudis and the Emiratis have been discussing an interim plan “imed in part at aligning them with Mr. Trump”hat would establish direct telecommunications links with Israel, allow overflight rights to Israeli aircraft and lift restrictions on some trade —ut only if Israel froze settlements outside the large blocks along the Green Line and eased Gaza’ commercial quarantine. Any of these concessions would cause hard-line ministers on the Israeli right to bolt, though they are acceptable to Netanyahu’ rivals in the opposition.

Mr. Netanyahu, to be sure, still has powerful Republican allies like Senator Lindsey Graham and the casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson . And Mr. Trump has not encountered them pushing back —et.

But one thing is clear. The administration is operating from an emerging logic that could well appeal to many more Republicans and a great many Democrats as well. President Trump has said he wants the “ltimate deal,”nd the people around him —ho may well outlast him —o, too.

WASHINGTON —resident Trump declared angrily on Thursday that he was the victim of a witch hunt, and contradicted his deputy attorney general on the firing of the F.B.I. director, in an extensive denial of any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Mr. Trump used a chaotic White House news conference with Colombia’ leader to directly confront a weeklong barrage of criticism and questions in a political storm that he said was dividing the nation. He also conspicuously distanced himself from aides like his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in repeating his claim that Moscow and its agents had not secretly assisted his campaign.

“ respect the move,”r. Trump said of the Justice Department’ decision on Wednesday to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter. “ut the entire thing has been a witch hunt.”

“nd there is no collusion between, certainly, myself and my campaign —ut I can always speak for myself —nd the Russians,”e said. “ero.”

Mr. Trump made his comments while standing alongside Colombia’ president, Juan Manuel Santos. As he dug in his heels, Mr. Trump further muddied his explanation of why he dismissed the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey —nd in doing so, offered a different version of events from one given to senators just hours earlier by the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.

In that meeting, Mr. Rosenstein outlined his decision to appoint Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel. Several senators emerged afterward to say Mr. Rosenstein had told them he was certain that the president was going to dismiss Mr. Comey, even before he wrote a memo critical of the director’ performance.

But at his news conference, Mr. Trump reverted to the White House’ original claim that he was primarily responding to Mr. Rosenstein’ recommendation to dismiss Mr. Comey. The president had later claimed that he had moved against Mr. Comey in part because of his frustration over the F.B.I.’ handling of the Russia investigation.

“irector Comey was very unpopular with most people,”r. Trump said on Thursday. “hen I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision. Because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side, not only the Republican side, that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.”

There was a palpable sense among the senators who filed out of the briefing room that the center of gravity in the investigation was shifting from Capitol Hill to Mr. Mueller, who will spend weeks assembling a staff and a list of witnesses to interview.

“his pretty much shuts Congress down,”enator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters. “emocrats, you got what you wanted. You got a special counsel. Now we’l just move on. We’e not prosecutors.”

The prospect of Mr. Mueller, a former federal prosecutor with a reputation for moral rectitude and an exacting management style, opening a wide-ranging investigation further rattled a demoralized White House staff, only a day before Mr. Trump was scheduled to depart on a grueling nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. Several of Mr. Trump’ advisers and associates have urged him to hire an experienced outside lawyer to help him deal with the surging controversy over whether his campaign had ties to Russia, according to several people briefed on the conversations.

Mr. Trump began the day in a defiant mood, abandoning the conciliatory tone the White House had shown in a statement Wednesday evening. In an early-morning Twitter post, he cited, without evidence, “llegal acts”ommitted by the administration of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, and the campaign of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton —nd said they had never led to a special counsel.

“ith all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!”r. Trump wrote on Twitter, initially misspelling counsel.

Moments later, he added, “his is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!”

The president was correct in his observation about the rarity of a special counsel, though his references to the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration did little to bolster his case. There were multiple congressional investigations into the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the role played by Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, and Mr. Obama.

It was not the first time Mr. Trump likened the questions about his campaign and Russia to a witch hunt. In January, while president-elect, he said in an interview with The New York Times that the persistent focus on Russia’ hacking of the American presidential campaign was a witch hunt carried out by people bitter at his victory.

The president elaborated on that theme in the news conference, casting the investigation as a needless distraction from the achievements of his administration, which he enthusiastically enumerated.

“e’e had tremendous success,”e said. “ou look at our job numbers. You look at what’ going on at the border.”

Some of Mr. Trump’ claims raised more questions than answers. “ou’e going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation,”e said, referring to the defense secretary, Jim Mattis. “he numbers are staggering, how successful they’e been.”

He promised to name a new F.B.I. director soon, having acknowledged to reporters earlier in the day that former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was a top contender.

Mr. Trump’ sense of grievance over the Russia investigations had been deepening even before the naming of a special counsel. On Thursday, he arrived in the East Room primed for confrontation.

Rather than call on a reporter from a conservative-leaning news organization, as he has in the past, Mr. Trump pointed to Jonathan Karl, an ABC News correspondent known for his close questioning during White House briefings.

When a second reporter, Scott Thuman of the broadcaster Sinclair, asked Mr. Trump whether he had urged Mr. Comey to drop the Russia investigation, Mr. Thuman could not finish the question before the president interrupted. “o. No,”r. Trump snapped. “ext question.”

Mr. Santos, a Harvard-trained economist who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for negotiating a peace treaty with the FARC guerrillas, watched the spectacle with an inscrutable expression. After he sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with the White House plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt the flow of drugs into the United States, Mr. Trump jumped in.

“hat was a very long and very diplomatic answer,”r. Trump said. “ will say it a bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel.”

Earlier, Mr. Trump said that coca cultivation and cocaine production had risen to record levels in Colombia, and challenged Mr. Santos to remedy the problem.

Mr. Santos returned the favor minutes later when asked whether he had advice for Mr. Trump.

“ don’ think I’ in a position to give any advice to President Trump,”r. Santos said with a smile. “e can take care of himself.”

David A. Clarke, the Milwaukee County sheriff who once claimed that ISIS and Black Lives Matter activists were forming an alliance to destroy America, said on a radio show Wednesday that he would accept a senior position at the Homeland Security Department.

Appearing on a Milwaukee radio show, Sheriff Clarke said he would take over the office that coordinates the Department of Homeland Security's outreach efforts for state, local, tribal, territorial governments and local law enforcement agencies. The position does not require Senate confirmation.

But the White House declined to comment on Sheriff Clarke's announcement, and the Homeland Security Department, in an emailed statement, said that ''such senior positions are announced by the department when made official by the secretary. No such announcement with regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made.''

On the radio program, Sheriff Clarke, known for his cowboy hats and brash statements, said, ''I'm both honored and humbled to be appointed to this position, working for the Trump administration.''

Sheriff Clarke, who gained national attention when he spoke at the Republican National Convention, is a vocal proponent of gun rights and a member of the National Rifle Association. That association has often brought him into conflict with the Black Lives Matter movement, which was formed after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager, in 2014 Ferguson, Mo.

Sheriff Clarke called the Ferguson demonstrators ''vultures on a roadside carcass.''

This month, a grand jury recommended criminal charges against several staff members at a jail run by Sheriff Clarke in connection with the death of an inmate last year.

Terrill Thomas, who had bipolar disorder, died in April 2016 after the staff members cut off the water in his cell for a week. The grand jury did not recommend criminal charges against Sheriff Clarke, who has declined to discuss the matter.

The sheriff will replace John Barsa, who is listed as the current acting assistant secretary.

After Sheriff Clarke's announcement, Chris Abele, the Milwaukee County executive, said in a statement, ''The appointment of Sheriff Clarke to a position intended to build partnership and engagement is not a decision made by someone interested in partnership or engagement.''

Some former Homeland Security Department officials expressed outrage that Sheriff Clarke would take a position at the agency.

Juliette N. Kayyem, who was assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter: ''I am floored. And feel for my career staff.''

Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, wrote in a Twitter post: ''Sheriff David Clarke's unconscionable record makes him unfit to serve. This appointment is a disgrace.''

U.S. and E.U. Confer on Possible Laptop Ban on Trans-Atlantic Flights

BRUSSELS —merican and European officials met on Wednesday in Brussels to discuss aviation security after the United StatesDepartment of Homeland Security said it was considering a ban on laptop computers and tablets in the cabins of trans-Atlantic flights.

The session, between Elaine C. Duke, the deputy secretary of Homeland Security, and representatives of various European Union countries and the European Commission, the bloc’ executive body, was called after the Europeans asked for clarification about any new restrictions —nd the terrorist threats that prompted them.

A senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting said that certain European officials were given insight into a developing aviation security threat.

Terrorist groups, the official said, were pursuing various innovations, including putting explosives in consumer devices.

The official added that the Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, could impose the measure in the next several days or weeks.

A senior European Union official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, confirmed that the Americans shared information about what was behind the reports about the proposed restrictions.

In March, the United States and Britain barred passengers traveling through airports in a number of Muslim-majority countries from carrying laptop computers, tablets and other devices larger than cellphones aboard direct inbound flights.

The larger items were to be stowed with checked luggage.

Officials said that the restrictions were put in place after intelligence showed that the Islamic State was developing a bomb that could be hidden in portable electronic devices.

In Europe, however, there is a deep wariness that extending the restrictions there would create vast complications for airports and airlines on one of the busiest corridors for international air travel.

Last year, 31 million passengers departed European airports on flights to the United States, and 3.5 million of those passengers connected from flights that originated outside of Europe, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry group representing 265 airlines.

Some companies restrict their employees from checking laptop computers as stowed luggage to prevent sensitive business information being lost or stolen.

And some aviation experts say that storing so many electronics in an airplane’ hold could heighten the risk of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.

On Tuesday, Alexandre de Juniac, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, advised European and American officials to “void the concentration of lithium battery-powered devices in the cargo hold of passenger aircraft.”

In a letter to Mr. Kelly and Violeta Bulc, the European commissioner for transportation, Mr. de Juniac said the current American prohibition of large electronic devices on flights from countries in the Middle East and North Africa affected about 50 flights each day; extending the ban to Europe would affect a further 390 flights per day and cost passengers $1.1 billion each year, mostly because of longer travel times and the inability of passengers to work during flights.

Mr. de Juniac suggested there were alternatives to expanding the laptop ban, including the greater use of detection systems to test whether people had handled explosives; asking passengers to turn on their devices to detect possible tampering; using more trained dogs to sniff out explosives on passengers; and using programs to detect low-risk travelers.

According to a joint statement released after the Brussels meeting, the Americans and the Europeans plan to meet next week in Washington to discuss technical issues.

Putin Offers Congress ‘ecord’f Trump’ Disclosures to Russian Envoys

MOSCOW —sserting himself abroad with his customary disruptive panache, President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday jumped into the furor over President Trump’ disclosure of classified information to Russian diplomats, declaring that nothing secret had been revealed and that he could prove it.

Mr. Putin, who has a long record of seizing on foreign crises to make Russia’ voice heard, announced during a news conference in Sochi, Russia, the Black Sea resort that has become his equivalent of Mr. Trump’ Mar-a-Lago, that he has a “ecord”f the American president’ meeting at the White House with two senior Russian officials and was ready to give it to Congress —o long as Mr. Trump does not object.

Referring to reports that Mr. Trump had revealed highly classified intelligence, Mr. Putin said, “t’ hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next.”

Mr. Putin’ offer to release a record of what was said, made after a meeting with the visiting prime minister of Italy, Paulo Gentiloni, suggested less an effort to create clarity over what Mr. Trump actually said in the Oval Office last Wednesday than a headline-grabbing assertion of his own authority and a reminder that he should not be ignored.

To that end, the Russian government has been angling for months for a meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump, who has met a host of foreign leaders since he took office in January but only spoken with the Russian president by telephone. They are expected to get together during a summit meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Germany in July.

As with many of Mr. Putin’ maneuvers, his offer to release a record of the White House meeting with Russia’ foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and its Washington ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, seemed designed to unnerve and confuse.

For a start, the offer left everyone guessing about what kind of “ecord”r. Putin has of his diplomats’eeting with Mr. Trump. Intentionally or otherwise, Mr. Putin muddied the waters by using a Russian word that can mean both audio recording and a written account. A Kremlin aide, Yury Ushakov, later clarified that Moscow has in its possession a written transcript, not a tape.

“ think Putin gets personal pleasure from exploiting the vulnerable position Trump has found himself in,”aid Valeriy Solovey, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. “utin feels superior and this flatters him.”

But, he added, the main target of Mr. Putin’ intervention was domestic opinion, as has been the case with most moves by the Russian president that baffle and dismay foreigners.

“his was a well prepared impromptu move,”r. Solovey said. “he goal is to demonstrate the superiority of the Russian political system, in which major decisions can be made swiftly and effectively. From the Russian point of view, what happens in Washington these days demonstrates the total inability of the U.S. president to make any decisions that are needed in this situation.”

Mr. Putin’ remarks are unlikely to please the White House, which has given conflicting accounts of what Mr. Trump told the Russians and has resisted giving details of their conversation.

Aleksei V. Makarkin, deputy head of the Center for Political Techologies, a Moscow research group, said he doubted Mr. Putin had set out to offend Mr. Trump and questioned whether the Russian record would ever see the light of day.

“n the personal level, Trump clearly wants to improve relations with Russia. The problem is that he is also president of the U.S., head of the state apparatus. This makes it much more difficult to make deals with Russia,”r. Makarkin said.

Mr. Putin’ offer, he added, was “ure rhetoric because the condition is that Trump should sign up to the idea. The American side should give its permission and this is a big problem. How can it give its permission if secret matters were discussed?”

And even if the White House does assent to the release of the Russian record, making it public is unlikely to clear the air, Mr. Makarkin said. “f Russia published a transcript, people wouldn’ believe it anyway,”e added. “he media can say that not everything was published and that this document cannot be trusted,”

American officials have said that Mr. Trump revealed secret information provided by Israel about a planned terrorist operation by the Islamic State militant group. In the process, they say, he named the city in Syria where the information was collected, potentially jeopardizing the source.

Mr. Trump has acknowledged discussing terrorism but has not specified what he told the Russian envoys.

Mr. Putin dismissed the claim that Mr. Trump had revealed any information that could be considered highly sensitive, returning to a favorite Kremlin theme: that the United States is gripped by an anti-Russian fever.

“hat surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation, using anti-Russian slogans. Either they don’ understand the damage they’e doing to their own country, in which case they are simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which case they are dangerous and corrupt,”r. Putin said.

Making light of the Oval Office episode and the value of Mr. Trump’ disclosure, Mr. Putin joked that he would reprimand Mr. Lavrov because “e hasn’ shared those secrets with us.”

Mr. Putin’ fans in Russia reacted with delight to Mr. Putin’ move, with Sergei A. Markov, an analyst close to the Kremlin, rejoicing on Twitter over the Russian president’ assertiveness. “ell done, Putin. He surfed the wave into the U.S. information storm,”r. Markov wrote.

Russia, where the political elite celebrated Mr. Trump’ defeat of Hillary Clinton in November, has grown increasingly disillusioned of late with the new administration’ failure to deliver on Mr. Trump’ campaign pledges to “et along”ith Moscow. A Facebook page named “ussians for Donald Trump” amended its name to add “.I.P.,”fter Mr. Trump ordered missile attacks on Russia’ ally, Syria, in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack.

Mr. Putin and his aides have repeatedly denied allegations that Russia interfered in last year’ presidential election in the United States through cyber attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the spread of disinformation.

At the same time, however, it has reaped great benefit from all the attention focused on Russia, even if most of it is negative. Accusations of Russian meddling have played into a domestic propaganda campaign that portrays all the country’ economic and other problems as a result of Russophobic foreigners intent on vilifying Russia. Moreover, the image of Moscow in the United States as a master manipulator has only reinforced Mr. Putin’ status as a supremely competent leader.

“ussian authorities are amused by the greatly exaggerated role attributed to Russia in the America’ internal political life,”r. Solovey said. “his is a very beneficial topic for the Russian propaganda machine.”

Can He Be Trusted With State Secrets?

On Monday, Americans learned that President Trump shared with the Russians highly classified intelligence about the United States fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump jocularly passed secrets obtained by Israel to Kremlin representatives in a White House meeting last week, blithely endangering America's relationship with a vital counterterrorism ally and its national security.

Republicans called Mr. Trump's act ''deeply disturbing,'' ''troubling'' and ''very serious.'' It is worse than that. It is further proof of the menace posed by an erratic president who, we now learn, may also have interfered with the F.B.I.'s investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Mr. Trump defended himself (on Twitter, as usual) by asserting that sharing highly classified intelligence with a foreign adversary is something ''I have the absolute right to do.'' What's terrifying is that he's right. But what he fails to grasp is that he was elected to protect American interests, not his own.

How then can Congress's Republican leaders seem so diffident? Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said, ''It would be helpful if the president spent more time on things we're trying to accomplish.'' Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said through a spokesman that he ''hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.'' But so far the best he's gotten is another Trumpian Twitter blast in which the president vowed to avenge caps-lock ''LEAKERS'' among the American intelligence professionals whose years of work he may have unraveled with his ad-hoc bumbling.

There's a danger to overthinking this man. We needn't apply, as the Times columnist David Brooks put it, the ''vast analytic powers of the entire world ... trying to understand a guy whose thoughts are often just six fireflies beeping randomly in a jar.''

Mr. Trump created this latest crisis during an immature boast about himself. ''I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,'' he is reported to have said, before telling Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, about his knowledge of an ISIS plot.

After his Russian guests left the Oval Office, White House officials struggled to limit the damage by contacting the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency and trying to scrub transcripts from the meeting. The news media has withheld the most sensitive details of what Mr. Trump told the Russians. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, mounted an odd and hairsplitting defense, saying that Mr. Trump's disclosure was ''wholly appropriate'' while acknowledging that Mr. Trump didn't know the source of the information and had blurted it out at the spur of the moment.

It is bad enough that the intelligence community is now likely to do what it can to wall off sensitive information, sources and methods from this irresponsible leader. But the president of the United States has unlimited access to the nation's secrets, and virtually unfettered authority to act unilaterally on matters of national security. That is enshrined in our Constitution -- but so are means for curtailing the danger posed by a leader who misuses that power.

So far, Republicans in Congress repeat the mantra we heard during Mr. Trump's campaign: that he is coachable and will mature in office. Or, maybe his White House will, as Senator Bob Corker put it on Monday night, ''bring itself under control and in order. ... Obviously they're in a downward spiral right now and they've got to figure out a way to come to grips.''

That's not going to happen. We are seeing the real Mr. Trump. This same inattention and ignorance, vanity and foolish impulsivity nearly sank his business -- until his lenders stepped in before he took them down with him.

So what will Republicans do, as he threatens to do the same to all of us? They might start devising a plan. The downward spiral is accelerating.

[Video: Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster's news conference Watch on YouTube.]

WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Tuesday defended his decision to share sensitive information about an Islamic State threat with Russian officials as the White House once again struggled to reconcile seemingly conflicting accounts of the president's actions.

A day after his advisers disputed a news article about the conversation, the president focused instead on justifying what he did and blaming those who disclosed it. In a series of early-morning posts on Twitter, he said he had the ''absolute right'' to give ''facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety'' to Russia's foreign minister and ambassador.

Asked about the conversation by reporters during a later appearance with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, Mr. Trump again did not deny providing the information, but he instead cast it as an attempt to collaborate with Russia in the war against the Islamic State. ''We're going to have a lot of great success over the coming years, and we want to get as many to fight terrorism as possible,'' he said.

The White House tried to clarify, sending out Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, for the second time in less than 24 hours. General McMaster stood by his Monday night statement, when he said the original Washington Post article about the conversation ''as reported'' was ''false.'' And while he would not confirm that Mr. Trump disclosed classified information, General McMaster said the president did not expose the source because he was not told where it came from.

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the information about the Islamic State plot came from Israel and was considered so sensitive that American officials had not shared it widely within their own government or among allies. Intelligence officials worried that Mr. Trump, in his meeting with Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, provided enough details to effectively expose the source of the information and the manner in which it had been collected.

''What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged,'' General McMaster said.

General McMaster suggested that Mr. Trump did not violate any confidentiality agreement with the country that provided it, which he did not name. In fact, General McMaster said: ''The president wasn't even aware where this information came from. He wasn't briefed on the source or method of the information either.''

Moreover, he said, the president did not give away secrets by discussing the city the information came from, as reported, because it would have been obvious. ''It was nothing that you would not know from open source reporting in terms of a source of concern,'' General McMaster said. ''And it had all to do with operations that are already ongoing, had been made public for months.''

While General McMaster did not deny that White House officials had reached out to intelligence agencies after Mr. Trump's revelations to contain any potential damage, he said he could not explain why. ''I would say maybe for an overabundance of caution,'' he said. ''I'm not sure.''

The general's briefing came hours after Mr. Trump went on Twitter to defend his actions. ''As president,'' Mr. Trump wrote, ''I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.''

As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining.... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017

...to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017

The news was first reported by The Post, and many organizations -- including BuzzFeed, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, CNN and The New York Times -- quickly published their own accounts of the disclosure.

Mr. Trump's Twitter posts on Tuesday morning appeared to undercut the carefully worded statements made by his advisers Monday night to try to dispute the original news reports without taking issue with specific facts in them. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said in a statement that the president ''did not discuss sources, methods or military operations'' with the Russians.

But The Post and the other news organizations did not report that he had done so. Instead, they focused on the breach of espionage etiquette, and on the possibility that American allies might be discouraged from sharing intelligence with the United States. They also noted Mr. Trump's tendency to go off script, at times to the chagrin of his advisers.

In his briefing on Tuesday, General McMaster suggested that there was no distinction between his quasi denial and the president's seeming confirmation. ''I stand by my statement I made yesterday,'' he said. ''What I'm saying is really the premise of that article is false.''

This has become something of a pattern: On Thursday, Mr. Trump told NBC News that the F.B.I.'s investigation of his campaign's ties to Russia had been a factor in his decision to fire the bureau's director, James B. Comey, and that the decision was not related to a recommendation from the deputy attorney general. Those comments undercut the accounts provided by his vice president and other advisers.

In his Tuesday posts on Twitter, Mr. Trump tried to turn attention away from whether he had leaked information to finding those who had disclosed what he had done. ''I have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community,'' he wrote.

Administration officials were blindsided by the president's messages early Tuesday and scrambled to reconcile the gap between them and General McMaster's comments. Mr. Trump's aides realized that not having General McMaster answer questions Monday night was going to prolong the story into a new day. But they believed they had been hamstrung by administration lawyers about exactly what could be said.

The firestorm comes at a challenging time for Mr. Trump's besieged team. His national security and foreign policy staffs have been spending much of their time planning for his coming eight-day trip to the Middle East and Europe -- his first overseas trip as president, and an opportunity, they thought, to reset the narrative of his presidency after the lingering controversy of Mr. Comey's sudden dismissal last week.

That came to a crashing halt with the revelations on Monday, with staffers being forced, yet again, to go into damage-control mode. At least one member of Mr. Trump's team assigned to defend him said the president's shifting stories and impulsiveness were making it hard to recruit talented outsiders needed to staff the still short-handed West Wing.

The story touched off a flurry of condemnations from Democrats who recalled how Mr. Trump had called for Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned for mishandling classified information by using a private email server. Even a number of Republicans expressed varying levels of concern and called for an accounting of what had happened.

''If the reporting is accurate, in one fell swoop, the president could have unsettled our allies, emboldened our adversaries, endangered our military and intelligence officers the world over, and exposed our nation to greater risk,'' Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said on the Senate floor.

Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on ''Morning Joe'' on MSNBC that General McMaster's statement was not actually a denial. ''When I look at McMaster's quote, it's a pretty technical quote,'' Mr. Sasse said. ''I think it's actually something quite different from a full rebuttal of the story.''

But other Republicans said they were willing to reserve judgment. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday morning that he was inclined to believe the White House version of events over the news media, which he said had no way of knowing the entire story. ''They were not in the room,'' he said in an interview on Hugh Hewitt's radio show.

''I suspect the administration will brief the Congress more fully on exactly what transpired,'' Mr. Cotton said during the interview. ''But I have much greater confidence in the word of H. R. McMaster on the record, in front of cameras, than I do anonymous sources in the media.''

Still, there was evident fatigue among Republicans with the latest episode. ''I think we could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things so that we can focus on our agenda,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, said on Bloomberg Television.

The episode fueled questions about Mr. Trump's relationship with Moscow at the same time that the F.B.I. and congressional committees are investigating whether his associates cooperated with Russian meddling in last year's election. Mr. Trump has repeatedly dismissed such suspicions as false stories spread by Democrats to explain their election defeat. But his friendly approach toward President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in spite of Moscow's intervention in Ukraine and other actions has stirred controversy.

The Post reported that Mr. Trump had described details of an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.

Last week, American officials said they might move to ban laptops from carry-on baggage on all flights from Europe to the United States -- a change that would inconvenience many business travelers, who would be forced to check computers in their luggage.

The issue is scheduled to be the subject of a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon in Brussels between Elaine C. Duke, the deputy secretary of Homeland Security, and Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Union's commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship.

Russia dismissed the reports on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry denied that Mr. Trump had given classified information to Russian officials, and she denigrated American news reports of the disclosure as ''fake.''

''I just landed in Madrid,'' the spokeswoman, Maria V. Zakharova, wrote on Facebook during a work trip to Spain. ''I turned on the phone, and there were dozens of messages. 'Maria Vladimirovna, is it true Trump revealed the most important secret?'''

Ms. Zakharova called the report ''the latest fake'' and disparaged the newspapers that published it: ''Guys, you are again reading American newspapers? You should not read them. They can be used in various ways, but there's no need to read them -- lately, this is not only harmful, but dangerous.''

Trump May Have Shifted Policy on Russia. Or Not.

MOSCOW -- President Trump's acknowledgment that he shared intelligence on terrorism with Russia was something of a coup for President Vladimir V. Putin, whose mantra about forging a global alliance to fight violent extremists never gained much traction in the West.

Mr. Putin's repeated calls for unity in fighting terrorism -- delivered from the podium of the United Nations, at countless global summit meetings and after every grisly attack around the world -- have often been met with skepticism, interpreted as smoke screens to cloak the violence fomented by the Kremlin in places like Chechnya, Ukraine and Syria.

Then on Tuesday, an American president seemed to take up that call, at least momentarily, with Mr. Trump writing on Twitter that sharing sensitive intelligence information with Russia on counterterrorism was a good idea. ''I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism,'' he wrote.

That could signal a major policy shift, political analysts said.

''The Kremlin has been so skillful in getting the president of the United States to cooperate in an unusual way,'' said Maxim Trudolyubov, a Russian political analyst and columnist. ''It is a big and completely unexpected coup for the Kremlin.''

Mr. Putin has long sought such cooperation. In part, he owes his 17 years leading Russia as either president or prime minister to the fact that he defeated a domestic insurgency in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus by branding it as part of the global war on terrorism and flattening the place. Although Al Qaeda was almost certainly active in Chechnya, no one outside Russia paid much attention to Mr. Putin's warnings about extremism there -- until after the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.

His antiterrorism campaign is central to his grand overall strategy of restoring Russia to the superpower status it enjoyed in Soviet times.

Yet given the whims of Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudolyubov and others said, it is unclear that such cooperation will endure. The unexpected manner in which the information was shared makes it difficult to assess whether it reflects a permanent shift in course.

''It is not something that Russia can rely on, because Trump changes like the weather,'' Mr. Trudolyubov said. ''It's the kind of victory that you do not really want if you want orderly policy cooperation.''

Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would work more closely with Russia, and this latest episode could indicate that he is following through.

Previously, mistrust of Russian motives always seemed to eventually outweigh any advantage of an alliance, prompting bitter frustration in Moscow. There has been little cooperation on Syria, for example, because most Western leaders see Russian intervention as more about strengthening President Bashar al-Assad as the Kremlin's main Arab ally than fighting the Islamic State.

Although Moscow asserted that chasing Islamist militants from the ancient ruins of Palmyra -- twice -- proved that it was defending civilized Western values, Russian firepower has largely been focused against the uprising confronting Mr. Assad.

Outside of the Islamic State, a shared definition of who constitutes a terrorist in Syria does not exist, and the Pentagon has been leery about cooperation.

''The problem is that both Russia and the U.S. mean different things when they talk about the fight against terrorism in Syria,'' said Ivan Kurilla, an expert on Russian-American relations at the European University at St. Petersburg. ''The question is whether they will try to bridge the gap in their understanding.''

In addition, it is taken as a given in Russia that whatever Mr. Trump wants, the real establishment in Washington will put a stop to it if it clashes with its interests. ''It is not a question of whether Trump wants to or not, it is a question of whether Trump can or not,'' said Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin.

Still, disparaging asides about Mr. Trump that had been creeping into official newscasts will most likely vanish.

''I would expect the Russians will now stop criticizing Mr. Trump as they have done during the last month or so,'' Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, the director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email.

Even if the Kremlin has reason to be pleased with the latest episode, Mr. Putin and the Russian government prefer that policy changes happen in an orderly, choreographed manner.

If the United States and Russia are to forge genuine new cooperation on terrorism, analysts said, Russia would prefer that it emerge from a meeting between the two presidents, scheduled for July, not via Twitter and confusing, contradictory denials in Washington.

In any case, the Oval Office episode was not big news in Russia, where the main headline of the day was Ukraine's shutting down key Russian social media and information sites, including Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and Yandex, Russia's version of Google.

Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin's spokesman, dismissed the reports from the White House. ''For us, this is not a subject,'' he told reporters. ''This is the latest nonsense.''

Maria V. Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, called the reports ''fake news'' and suggested that people should stop reading American newspapers. ''They can be used in various ways, but there's no need to read them -- lately, this is not only harmful, but dangerous,'' she wrote on Facebook.

Few here accept the idea, at least publicly, that Russia helped Mr. Trump by stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, even if Russia has clearly stated that conducting hybrid information warfare is important to achieving its strategic goals.

One of those goals is undermining the Western institutions that oppose it. Whether anyone accepts that idea or not, there is glee in some quarters in Moscow at the confusion in the American capital.

''Of course, from Moscow, we look at this chaos with a bit of a smile,'' Mr. Markov said. ''So many Americans used to look at the chaos in Russia that way. It is a kind of psychological revenge.''

American officials preoccupied with domestic problems will also have less time to meddle in Russian affairs, he added.

Most Russians expect that the United States will endure given the strength of its institutions, its economy and its overall resources. Some wonder, however, if the dysfunction at the White House will descend to the level that paralyzed the Kremlin in the worst, last days of the Soviet Union, or even to that of pre-Putin Russia.

There were sarcastic remarks regarding the White House in a commentary on Channel One, a state-run television station, during a news program on Sunday.

''The new action-packed series, tentatively titled 'Secrets of Trump's Oval Office,' becomes more fascinating every day,'' said a commentator named Evgeny Baranov. ''Russia's footprint, that is in one way or another present in each new episode, only enhances the intrigues of this bold plotline.''

It's Chicken Or Fish

Since President Trump's firing of F.B.I. Director James Comey, one question has been repeated over and over: With Democrats lacking any real governing power, are there a few good elected men or women in the Republican Party who will stand up to the president's abuse of power as their predecessors did during Watergate?

And this question will surely get louder with the report that Trump asked Comey in February to halt the investigation into the president's former national security adviser.

But we already know the answer: No.

The G.O.P. never would have embraced someone like Trump in the first place -- an indecent man with a record of multiple bankruptcies, unpaid bills and alleged sexual harassments who lies as he breathes -- for the answer to ever be yes. Virtually all the good men and women in this party's leadership have been purged or silenced; those who are left have either been bought off by lobbies or have cynically decided to take a ride on Trump's Good Ship Lollipop to exploit it for any number of different agendas.

It has not been without costs. Trump has made every person in his orbit look like either a ''liar or a fool,'' as David Axelrod put it. So call off the search. There will be no G.O.P. mutiny, even if Trump resembles Captain Queeg more each day.

That's why the only relevant question is this: Are there tens of millions of good men and women in America ready to run and vote as Democrats or independents in the 2018 congressional elections and replace the current G.O.P. majority in the House and maybe the Senate?

Nothing else matters -- this is now a raw contest of power.

And the one thing I admire about Trump and his enablers: They are not afraid of, and indeed they enjoy, exercising raw power against their opponents. They are not afraid to win by a sliver and govern as if they won by a landslide.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had the power to block President Barack Obama from naming a Supreme Court justice and he did not hesitate to use it, the Constitution be damned.

Trump had the power to appoint climate deniers to key environmental posts and he did it -- science be damned. And Trump had the power to fire Comey, even though it meant firing the man investigating him for possible collusion with Russia, and Trump did just that -- appearances be damned.

Democrats and independents should not be deluded or distracted by marches on Washington, clever tweets or ''Saturday Night Live'' skits lampooning Trump. They need power. If you are appalled by what Trump is doing -- backed by House and Senate Republicans -- then you need to get out of Facebook and into somebody's face, by running for Congress as a Democrat or an independent, registering someone to vote for a Democrat or an independent, or raising money to support such candidates.

Nothing else matters.

The morally bankrupt crowd running today's G.O.P. are getting their way not because they have better arguments -- polls show majorities disagreeing with them on Comey and climate -- but because they have power and are not afraid to use it, no matter what the polls say. And they will use that power to cut taxes for wealthy people, strip health care from poor people and turn climate policy over to the fossil fuel industry until someone else checks that power by getting a majority in the House or the Senate.

Personally, I'm not exactly a rabid Democrat. I'm more conservative on issues of free trade, business, entrepreneurship and use of force than many Democratic candidates. I think the country would benefit from having a smart conservative party offering market and merit-based solutions for our biggest challenges -- from climate to energy to education to taxes to infrastructure -- that was also ready to meet Democrats halfway. But there is no such G.O.P. today. The party has lost its moral compass.

Just think about that picture of Trump laughing it up with Russia's foreign minister in the Oval Office, a foreign minister who covered up Syria's use of poison gas. Trump reportedly shared with him sensitive intelligence on ISIS, and Trump refused to allow any U.S. press in the room. The picture came from Russia's official photographer. In our White House! It's nauseating. And the G.O.P. is still largely mute. If Hillary had done that, they would have shut down the government.

That's why for me, in 2018, the most left-wing Democratic candidate for House or Senate is preferable to the most moderate Republican, because none of the latter will confront Trump. And Trump's presidency is not just a threat to my political preferences, it is a threat to the rule of law, freedom of the press, ethics in government, the integrity of our institutions, the values our kids need to learn from their president and America's longstanding role as the respected leader of the free world.

That's why there are just two choices now: chicken or fish -- a Democratic-controlled House or Senate that can at least deter Trump for his last two years, or four years of an out-of-control president. This G.O.P. is not going to impeach him; forget that fantasy. Either Democrats get a lever of power, or we're stuck emailing each other ''S.N.L.'' skits.

So, I repeat: Run as, raise money for or register someone to vote for a Democrat or independent running for House or Senate on Nov. 6, 2018. Nothing else matters.

It's chicken or fish, baby. It's just chicken or fish.

TV Drama Takes Arabs Inside Life Under  ISIS

A mother travels to Syria to find her son after he ran away to join the Islamic State. A Christian renounces her faith and plots to blow up a church. A black-clad matron tells teenage girls to rest up before they are raped by extremist fighters.

These frighteningly familiar stories of life under the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria will this month become plotlines on prime-time television across the Arab world.

A sprawling, 30-part dramatic series is scheduled to make its debut on MBC 1, the Arab world's most watched satellite channel, during the holy month of Ramadan, said Ali Jaber, the director of television for the MBC Network.

The network shared with The New York Times video, available below, from three episodes of the program, ''Black Crows.''

It paints a picture of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, as a brutal criminal organization run by corrupt and hypocritical leaders. But recruits are depicted as victims, and women who challenge the militants' control are heroes.

In one episode from the series, a Yazidi slave is sent to clean an Islamic State fighter's room, where his bored wife asks if the woman is hungry or would like to watch a movie. The captive woman is outraged.

The stories of women dominate the series, the producers said, because they offered rich dramatic material. A majority of the channel's viewers are women.

In another episode, Islamic State commanders indoctrinate children into their ranks.

Like the Islamic State's recruits, the cast comes from across the Arab world, and the program's plotlines reflect well-known headlines about the group's atrocities.

Ramadan, which will begin around May 27, is a month on the Islamic calendar during which Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. It is also peak television season in the Arab world, where families gather after breaking their fast to binge-watch shows late into the night.

In television terms, ''it's like the Super Bowl for 30 days straight,'' said Mazen Hayek, a spokesman for MBC.

Typical programming includes romances, comedies and historical dramas, some of which reflect current events. Though the new MBC production has the trappings of a drama, and some of the costumes and makeup can be cartoonish, the series, set behind the jihadists' front lines, is not light viewing.

Another story line involves a journalist whose fiancéecame an Islamic State suicide bomber. She goes undercover to report on the group, and pledges to abandon her Christian faith and blow up a church.

The actress, Samar Allam, said in a phone interview that being on set and getting into character depressed her, but that she hoped the program would make people think in a way that news reports about the Islamic State's violence could not.

''ISIS is a danger to all of humanity,'' she said, using an acronym for the group. The show allowed her to ''show my hatred and my condemnation of this group, to express it in a concrete way.''

Marwa Mohamed, a Saudi actress, plays a woman who kills her husband for cheating on her and flees to join the Islamic State with her two sons. After one is sexually abused and the other is killed, she struggles to escape.

''It is important to wake people up and show them that Islam is not that,'' Ms. Mohamed said.

She said she hoped that despite the dark subject matter, viewers would tune in for the human stories. ''It's not all terrorism and war,'' she said. ''There are lots of dramatic stories in it as well.''

The series echoes news coverage of the Islamic State, with explosions that leave bodies scattered and gunmen waving black flags, but it dramatizes the lives of people forced to live under the group.

Mr. Jaber of MBC, who is known in the Arab world for being a judge on the reality competition ''Arabs Got Talent,'' said the series sought to harness the influence of popular television to undermine the narrative that the Islamic State uses to entice recruits.

''We believe that this is an epidemic, this is a disease that we have to muster the courage to address and fight,'' he said.

Still, producing a program about the Islamic State in the region where the group has done the most damage carries risks.

A comedy show on MBC that mocked the group led to death threats against its star. And Mr. Jaber said some sponsors might hesitate to advertise their products on such a violent series about a terrorist group.

''It will bring eyeballs, it will bring buzz and ratings and reputation, but no money,'' he said.

Since the Islamic State stormed through Syria and Iraq, shocking the world with its choreographed beheadings and elaborate executions, governments have struggled to defeat the group and counter its potent, made-for-television propaganda.

Some diplomats have told Mr. Jaber that they like the idea of using television to challenge the jihadists' message. In March, he was invited to discuss the show with Western and Middle Eastern diplomats at a summit meeting in Washington hosted by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.

Other Ramadan series, dramas and comedies have referred to the Islamic State, but ''Black Crows'' appears to be the first to be set entirely in the militants' world, said Rebecca Joubin, an associate professor of Arab studies at Davidson College who studies the region's television programs.

The most popular Ramadan shows are often escapist love stories, full of beautiful people wearing nice clothes. ''A lot of people are like: 'I don't want to watch this stuff. I see it on the news every day,' '' Ms. Joubin said.

Still, the series' producers expect it to be widely viewed during Ramadan, when MBC 1 traditionally sees a spike in viewership.

The show will be broadcast in Arabic as ''Al Gharabeeb Al Soud,'' and the network hopes to produce an English-language version for wider distribution.

The series ''Black Crows'' portrays the Islamic State as a brutal criminal organization run by hypocrites and the women who challenge the militants as heroes. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MIDDLE EAST BROADCASTING CENTER)

President Trump’ True Revelation: He Is Unfit for Office

On Monday, Americans learned that President Trump shared with the Russians highly classified intelligence about the United States fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump jocularly passed secrets obtained by Israel to Kremlin representatives in a White House meeting last week, blithely endangering America’ relationship with a vital counterterrorism ally and its national security.

Republicans called Mr. Trump’ act “eeply disturbing,”“roubling”nd “ery serious.”t is worse than that. It is further proof of the menace posed by an erratic president who, we now learn, may also have interfered with the F.B.I.’ investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Mr. Trump defended himself (on Twitter, as usual) by asserting that sharing highly classified intelligence with a foreign adversary is something “ have the absolute right to do.”hat’ terrifying is that he’ right. But what he fails to grasp is that he was elected to protect American interests, not his own.

How then can Congress’ Republican leaders seem so diffident? Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said, “t would be helpful if the president spent more time on things we’e trying to accomplish.”aul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said through a spokesman that he “opes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.”ut so far the best he’ gotten is another Trumpian Twitter blast in which the president vowed to avenge caps-lock “EAKERS”mong the American intelligence professionals whose years of work he may have unraveled with his ad-hoc bumbling.

There’ a danger to overthinking this man. We needn’ apply, as the Times columnist David Brooks put it, the “ast analytic powers of the entire world …rying to understand a guy whose thoughts are often just six fireflies beeping randomly in a jar.”

Mr. Trump created this latest crisis during an immature boast about himself. “ get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,”e is reported to have said, before telling Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, about his knowledge of an ISIS plot.

After his Russian guests left the Oval Office, White House officials struggled to limit the damage by contacting the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency and trying to scrub transcripts from the meeting. The news media has withheld the most sensitive details of what Mr. Trump told the Russians. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, mounted an odd and hairsplitting defense, saying that Mr. Trump’ disclosure was “holly appropriate”hile acknowledging that Mr. Trump didn’ know the source of the information and had blurted it out at the spur of the moment.

It is bad enough that the intelligence community is now likely to do what it can to wall off sensitive information, sources and methods from this irresponsible leader. But the president of the United States has unlimited access to the nation’ secrets, and virtually unfettered authority to act unilaterally on matters of national security. That is enshrined in our Constitution —ut so are means for curtailing the danger posed by a leader who misuses that power.

So far, Republicans in Congress repeat the mantra we heard during Mr. Trump’ campaign: that he is coachable and will mature in office. Or, maybe his White House will, as Senator Bob Corker put it on Monday night, “ring itself under control and in order. …bviously they’e in a downward spiral right now and they’e got to figure out a way to come to grips.”

That’ not going to happen. We are seeing the real Mr. Trump. This same inattention and ignorance, vanity and foolish impulsivity nearly sunk his business —ntil his lenders stepped in before he took them down with him.

So what will Republicans do, as he threatens to do the same to all of us? They might start devising a plan. The downward spiral is accelerating.
