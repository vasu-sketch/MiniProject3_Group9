WASHINGTON—he U.S. military said Tuesday that it attacked allies of the Syrian regime for the second time in three weeks after they ignored repeated warnings to move away from a base in southern Syria used by American forces.

The strike represents an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's military, which hadn't been a focus of American airstrikes until recently.

On Tuesday, the military said that it hit allies of Mr. Assad that refused to leave an informal 30-mile de-escalation zone around the base in al-Tanf, a town in southern Syria along the Jordan border.

On May 18, the U.S.-led coalition hit the pro-regime forces as they advanced toward al-Tanf, where U.S. special operations forces provide training and support for Syrian militants.

Since then, U.S. military officials said, the forces have refused to leave the de-escalation zone and increased their forces right outside the border.

Last week, the U.S. military used its deconfliction line with Russia to urge the forces to back down, but they refused. The fighters said they were there to battle Islamic State, also known as ISIS, the military said last week.

Instead, the U.S. military said, more than 60 pro-Syrian regime forces entered the area with a tank, artillery and antiaircraft weapons that posed a threat to U.S. forces and their allies.

The latest strike destroyed two artillery pieces and an antiaircraft weapon, the military said. It also damaged the tank.

"The coalition does not seek to fight Syrian regime or pro-regime forces but remains ready to defend themselves if pro-regime forces refuse to vacate the deconfliction zone," the military said. "The Coalition calls on all parties in southern Syria to focus their efforts on the defeat of ISIS, which is our common enemy and the greatest threat to regional and worldwide peace and security."

World
 ISIS  Claims Responsibility for Melbourne Attack, but Police Can't Verify Claim; Gunman Yacqub Khayre was killed by police

SYDNEY—uthorities said they are a treating a deadly siege in Melbourne as an act of terrorism, though they haven't found direct links between the perpetrator and Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack.

Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said Yacqub Khayre, a 29-year-old Australian who was on parole after serving seven years in jail for reckless intent to cause harm, appeared to be acting alone when he killed a hotel clerk at a serviced apartment building in the suburb of Brighton and took a woman hostage on Monday. Mr. Khayre was killed by police after firing on officers outside the building.

Mr. Ashton said the investigation will consider whether Mr. Khayre, who came to Australia as a child refugee from Somalia with his family, had planned to lure police into an ambush at the building, among other theories. Mr. Khayre earlier booked a room at the apartment and hired a prostitute, who was taken hostage during the siege but later rescued unharmed.

"Nothing that we have found thus far that suggests that it was planned or done in concert with others," Mr. Ashton said.

Police believe the gunman made a phone call to television broadcaster Channel Seven in which he said the attack was inspired by Islamic State and al Qaeda.

The incident in Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, is the third deadly attack in Australia by so-called lone wolf assailants with minimal links to organized terror groups. In December 2014, a gunman, later identified as Iranian immigrant Man Haron Monis, took over a central Sydney cafe and held a number of people hostage for 16 hours before police killed him to end the siege. Two hostages, the cafe's manager and a female customer, died.

In October 2015 a 15-year-old boy of Iraqi-Kurdish descent was shot and killed by New South Wales special constables moments after he gunned down a man outside police headquarters in Parramatta, a city more than 22 kilometers from central Sydney.

Australia's five-tier terrorism threat alert system has been set at "probable," the third-highest level, since September 2014.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the attack raised grave questions about Australia's parole system, given Mr. Khayre's criminal record of violence. Mr. Khayre was acquitted of terrorism charges years ago, but Mr. Turnbull said he was known to have links to terror groups in the past.

Mr. Ashton said police were aware of Islamic State's claim late Monday that Mr. Khayre was one of its "soldiers," in a statement posted to its official Amaq news agency, but hadn't found anything to suggest that he was in contact with overseas terror groups in the run-up to Monday's attack.

Officers have seized computer equipment and electronics from an address in Roxburgh Park, a Melbourne suburb, where Mr. Khayre lived with his mother.

The siege began around 4 p.m. local time on Monday when Mr. Khayre walked into the serviced apartment building and shot and killed the receptionist with a shotgun, who police said was an Australian national born in China. Police said the staff member wasn't known to the gunman. A woman then called the police and said a man had been killed at the building and a hostage situation was under way.

Police evacuated a nearby swimming school and roads were closed while armed officers got in position. Some residents stayed in the apartment block during the siege, which lasted about two hours. Three officers suffered gunshot wounds during the shootout at the end of the siege.

Australia's center-right government, a U.S. ally that has sent warplanes and special forces to help combat Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, has passed a number of antiterrorism laws that increase the powers of intelligence agencies and police to monitor and detain suspected extremists, in addition to prosecuting returning fighters, as worries mount about homegrown militancy.

The government also has introduced tough control orders limiting the movement of suspects as young as 14, while also allowing indefinite detention of jailed militants still who are believed to pose a security risk.

Late last year, Australian authorities said they disrupted a terrorist plot inspired by Islamic State to explode improvised bombs in central Melbourne on or around Christmas Day, with a railway station and a cathedral among the suspected targets.

Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews said he had spoken with Mr. Turnbull since Monday's attack. "If there are future steps that we need, to take processes that need to begin, then I think all of us will stand ready to do that," Mr. Andrews said.

London Attacker Khuram Butt Proselytized, Neighbors Say; Slain knife-wielder was in TV documentary on jihadism last year, sought to influence children

LONDON—olice identified one of the terrorists who struck London over the weekend as Khuram Butt, a 27-year-old Pakistani-born British citizen who neighbors said appeared in a television documentary about Islamic extremism in the U.K.

The father of two young children was one of three knife-wielding attackers killed in a hail of police bullets after mowing down pedestrians and stabbing people Saturday night. Eight people were killed and dozens more injured. Eighteen of the wounded were still in critical condition on Monday.

Authorities said Butt was "known to" police and the security services, but they said they had no intelligence suggesting he was planning an attack.

Another assailant was identified as Rachid Redouane, 30, who police said had claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan. Police said they were trying to determine the identity of the third attacker.

Neighbors of Butt in Barking, a district of East London, said he spent time proselytizing in a way that made them feel uneasy, sometimes seeking out children in a local park.

"He said very Islamic things. He said he was a soldier," said one neighbor, who asked that his name not be used. "My partner reported him for his extremism. They never came back to us. Nothing ever happened."

Another person who lived nearby, Regina Khan, said, "He mostly hung around with the teenage boys round here."

"We didn't find it comfortable, we found it scary," she added. "I used to tell my daughter there's something wrong with this guy, his aggression."

Butt and several other men were stopped by two policemen outside London's Regent's Park in July 2015, according to a documentary tracking a group of Muslim activists that aired on British television last year. Police asked the men if they had "an ISIS-looking" flag before searching them and let them go after an hour, according to the documentary's narrator.

Before being stopped, Butt and six other men were filmed praying before a black flag bearing Arabic writing. After the prayers, the men are seen sitting or sprawled on the grass in the summer sun, listening to preacher Mohammed Shamsuddin tell them not to be deterred.

"This is a passing time for us so this is a type of jihad for you, that you came out to do da'wah, enjoining good and forbidding evil," Mr. Shamsuddin said, using an Arabic term that refers to religious outreach. Butt appears in close-up, nodding at the words.

The 46-minute documentary by Jamie Roberts tracks a group of extremist preachers in London calling for the imposition of Islamic law in Britain. Before the prayers in the park, Mr. Shamsuddin appears using a loudspeaker outside a London mosque, flanked by police and telling worshipers and passersby that Shariah law is coming to the U.K.

Another man shown alongside Butt in the park, Abu Haleema, discusses in the film how police reviewed messages he exchanged with a 14-year old who was later convicted of plotting to kill police officers and sentenced to life in prison in 2015. Another man featured in the documentary, Siddhartha Dhar, was dubbed "Jihadi Sid" after a man believed to be him appeared in Islamic State videos making threats against the U.K.

Messrs. Haleema and Shamsuddin were reviled in the British press when the documentary aired. In one scene, the two men are shown laughing and snacking as they watch an Islamic State execution video played for them by the filmmaker. A spokeswoman for Channel 4, which aired the documentary in January 2016, declined to comment.

Mr. Roberts didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Dhar has been widely reported to have left for Syria. The whereabouts of Messrs. Haleema and Shamsuddin couldn't immediately be determined.

Last year, Butt knocked on the door of neighbor Michael Demitir, 33, bringing bread and rice and telling him, "My god says I must be nice to everyone." Mr. Demitir said Butt once asked if he and his family watched TV. When Mr. Demitir said yes, he said Butt replied: "TV is the devil. I don't watch TV. I only watch Allah."

About two months ago, Mr. Demitir said, Butt came knocking again, this time asking to take his 10-year-old son for a ride in his car. "I said, 'Oi, are you crazy, why do you want my kid, man? Stay away,'" Mr. Demitir said. "He raised his hands, smiled and walked away."

Ramana Huczko, another neighbor, said she had been to the park with Butt and her children. "He would be playing with the kids and would sometimes get down to pray," she said, adding that he was "very religious."

"He loved kids," she added. But Ms. Huczko said she refused a request from Butt to take her children, aged between 10 and 16, to McDonald's. "I said no, I'm not happy with this."

Samiya Mohammed, 18, who lives near Butt's apartment complex, said recently she had seen a change in his behavior.

"Maybe towards the end, people started feeling a bit weird about him. With the kids it was kind of too much. He was really close with one of the kids," she said, saying the boy was around nine years old.

Said Mohammed, who helps run a nearby mosque, said Butt's religious practices were a mystery.

"I always asked everybody where he prayed and no one knew," the 52-year-old repairman said. He said he had seen Butt pray in a couple of local mosques, but not regularly.

"He wasn't much of a Muslim," he said.

Iraqi Forces Disrupt Islamic State Supply Route; Troops capture town of Baaj, which lies between extremist strongholds of Mosul and Raqqa

MOSUL, Iraq—raqi paramilitary forces captured a hub on a key Islamic State supply route between Syria and Iraq, further disrupting the flow of fighters and goods between the terror group's major urban strongholds, Iraq's defense ministry said.

Units from Iraq's predominantly Shiite Muslim militias on Sunday retook the northwest town of Baaj, about 100 miles from Mosul, where Islamic State has lost substantial ground to U.S.-backed Iraqi forces. Baaj served as a staging ground for the extremists during a lightning advance that saw them seize about one-third of Iraq in 2014.

The town and the surrounding district, much of which sits on the Iraq-Syria border and which Iraqi forces also captured, have since been a main way station between Mosul and Raqqa, the Syrian city that is the group's de facto capital in Syria.

"It's a fatal blow to Daesh there since the liberation of the Baaj district means cutting off the connection between the Syrian Daesh in Raqqa and Iraqi Daesh in Mosul," said Brigadier Tahseen al-Khafaji, spokesman for the defense ministry, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

In 2015, Islamic State officials declared Baaj one of a few fallback cities in the event of the loss of a major stronghold like Mosul, said Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based expert studying Iraqi extremism.

Much of the border area is sparsely populated and porous, allowing Islamic State to ferry goods and fighters. But as key roads and towns come under Iraqi control, options for Islamic State to resupply are diminishing.

Iraq's army and allied paramilitary forces have since 2015 dealt the Sunni Muslim terror group a series of key battlefield defeats, greatly reducing the amount of territory under its control. The battle for Mosul, its remaining major urban stronghold in the country, kicked off in October.

Iraqi forces drove the extremists from east Mosul in late January, and have since February fought a grinding battle for the city's west side. Victory in Baaj came as Iraqi troops continued a slow final advance in Mosul, marked by difficulties in using air power or heavy artillery in the densely populated area and Islamic State's use of civilians as human shields.

At an operations center close to the front lines in Mosul, Iraqi army Col. Hussein Mustafa sat on Sunday with American advisers in a dark room with large monitors, watching aerial surveillance of the front lines.

Some 300 to 400 civilian families were still trapped in his sector, just outside of Mosul's Old City. The sector is only a fraction of what remains under Islamic State control in the city.

Elsewhere, closer to the fighting, the sound of gunfire sounded a few hundred yards away from a stream of civilians as they hurried away from the front lines, many weeping and praising God that they had finally escaped Islamic State occupation.

Col. Mustafa's men know they have made gains against the remaining militants whenever a wave of civilians flows toward them from a cleared neighborhood, he said, because it means Islamic State has retreated. Medical stations and aid workers get inundated with the sick and wounded.

A fleeing resident who gave his name as Abu Zakariah said Islamic State fighters were the only people eating and drinking with regularity in west Mosul, with civilians subsisting mainly on coarse bread and foul-smelling water. He pulled up his shirt to show a sunken stomach and bony hips, his three sons similarly emaciated.

In the Zinjili neighborhood near the Old City, streets and buildings have been destroyed and hulks of cars piled on the sides of the street. Islamic State forced everyone to move their cars into the streets to serve as roadblocks, residents and Iraqi forces said, and some have been booby-trapped.

Advancing on one street controlled by Islamic State, Iraqi forces and aid workers found dozens of civilians lying dead or wounded by the group's snipers, shot as they tried to flee, according to military officials and witnesses.

Some 30 families were shot, according to Iraq's defense ministry. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition backing Iraqi forces in the battle against Islamic State said troops had used artillery to fire smoke-dispersing rounds to block snipers' view of civilians and allow residents to reach safety.

At an aid station near the front lines, a man who gave his name only as Shamel looked on as a doctor stitched up a gash in his sister's scalp. The siblings had run for their lives after their house collapsed in an explosion, whose cause they didn't know. Much of his family was still in the house when they left, he said as he wept.

When asked about the family's plight, Col. Mustafa said he knew the house belonging to Shamel.

"It will take a day or two to get to it," he said. "It's still controlled by Daesh."

Caught on Video: The Philippines Casino Attack; Officials release video of incident that killed at least 36 people

MANILA, Philippines—resident Rodrigo Duterte said Saturday that a gunman's rampage at a Manila casino that led to a lethal fire wasn't an act of terrorism despite claims by Islamic State, while casino officials and police unveiled videos they said indicated arson and robbery.

Mr. Duterte said during a news briefing in the southern Philippines that he did not believe the attacker's motive was terrorism.

"That is not the work of the ISIS," he said, speaking of the casino attack directly for the first time since it erupted early Friday. "The work of the ISIS is more cruel and brutal. They would simply kill people for nothing, not even for a reason.''

The incident at the Resorts World complex near Manila's international airport left at least 36 people dead due to smoke inhalation, police said. Islamic State, whose allies are involved in a nearly two-week battle with troops in a southern Philippine city, said one of its followers carried out the violence but the government points to a botched one-man robbery.

Police haven't yet identified the man, whom they said spoke English and Tagalog.

The security footage, shown to media by the casino Saturday evening, showed a tall man dressed in black and carrying a black shoulder bag arriving by taxi at the casino at 12:07 a.m. Friday. He joined two guests in an elevator, then got out on a second-floor parking area.

The man donned a black mask and at 12:11 a.m. entered the casino, walking past a metal detector manned by a female security guard. The guard ran after him, but fled with other employees and guests as the man appeared to show his weapon or fire shots. He was wielding an M4 assault rifle, Armeen Gomez, chief security officer of Resorts World Manila, said at a news conference.

At 12:12 a.m., the footage showed the gunman entering another part of the casino and torching three gaming tables. He then set fire to another table in a gaming salon and other areas.

At 12:18 a.m., he went behind the cashiers' cage and shot and kicked his way into a room where chips were stored, taking about 113 million Philippine pesos ($2.3 million) worth of high-value black chips, casino and police officials said.

Footage next showed security personnel encountering the gunman in what appeared to be a stairwell. Shots were exchanged and the gunman was wounded. He made his way to a fifth-floor room, where he shot and kicked the door until it opened, footage showed. He burned linen in the corridor. Inside the room, and out of view of security cameras, he lay down on the bed, set himself on fire and fatally shot himself, Mr. Gomez said.

Oscar Albayalde, chief of Manila's police, said at the same news conference that the footage was being made public to show that the actions didn't resemble a terrorist attack.

"If he is really a terrorist, with all this ammunition with him, he would have shot everybody there, no?" Mr. Albayalde said, adding that the gunman changed magazines at least three times. "Until we get any indications that this is part of a terror attack or if he is a member of any terror group, then we could not possibly say that this is related to any terror attack."

Mr. Albayalde reiterated authorities' belief that the arson might have been a diversionary tactic to aid the gunman's escape.

Police were using dentures and blood taken from the stairwell to help determine the gunman's identity, Mr. Albayalde said. He added that the gunman spoke Tagalog, according to his taxi driver. Police said on Friday said the man appeared to be a foreigner, but didn't repeat that assessment Saturday.

Mr. Albayalde said that all of the victims, many of whom had barricaded themselves into bathrooms to escape the gunman, had suffocated. Among them were four people from Taiwan and one from mainland China, the Chinese Embassy in Manila said. No other foreigners were reported killed.

Islamic State fanned speculation Friday of a terror attack, claiming that the incident was carried out by a single fighter with the nom de guerre Abu al-Khayr al-Arkabili.

The Philippines is battling Islamic State-linked militants in the southern city of Marawi. Fighters from Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other countries have been killed, along with scores of civilians and troops. The fighting erupted when security forces tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, a militant leader whom Islamic State has named its "emir'" of a caliphate it hopes to establish in Muslim-majority areas of Southeast Asia. About 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting.

Pantaleon Alvarez, speaker of the lower house of Congress, on Saturday called the incident a "clear example of a 'lone wolf' terrorist attack."

''There is a thick fog of uncertainty, which will likely have a negative impact on investment confidence and hit the tourism and budding casino sector," said Richard Heydarian, security and political analyst at De La Salle University in Manila.

World News:  ISIS  Claim Clouds Probe in Deadly Fire --- Extremist group says it is behind Manila rampage, but police declare no terror link

MANILA -- Islamic State claimed responsibility for a rampage at a Manila casino early Friday that left at least 36 people dead, renewing terrorism concerns about an incident the Philippines government said was a botched one-man robbery attempt.

The statement echoed others in which Islamic State says it was behind attacks in which there was no operational link to the group.

The Philippines said it hasn't found any link to terrorism. Government spokesman Ernesto Abella described the suspect, who police said was a tall, fair-complexioned foreigner, as emotionally disturbed. Police have yet to identify him.

National police chief Gen. Ronald Dela Rosa said the suspect's plan appeared to be to rob the Resorts World casino before setting parts of the building on fire to distract law enforcers as he made his escape.

By the end of the night, responders had found the bodies of at least 36 suffocation victims in and around the casino hall, many of whom had barricaded themselves into bathrooms to escape the gunman. The attacker had killed himself in a hotel room, Gen. Dela Rosa said.

The incident at Resorts World, the largest casino complex in the country, began around midnight when the man entered the building from a second-floor car park carrying a semiautomatic rifle. Inside the casino, he fired into the air and set fire to gaming tables before ransacking a storage room and stuffing $2.3 million in gambling chips into a backpack, Gen. Dela Rosa said.

As smoke began to billow from the complex, the man tried to make his way out but was blocked by police. Resorts World's security team managed to shoot and wound him, forcing him back inside, where he holed up in a fifth-floor room, said the casino's chief operating officer, Stephen Reilly.

Gen. Dela Rosa said this was where the gunman took his own life.

"Apparently he lay on the bed and covered the blanket in gasoline and then set himself on fire," the national police chief said. The suspect then shot himself. "He was burned beyond recognition," he said.

That the suspect didn't shoot anyone was an indication that the incident was a failed robbery rather than terrorist attack, the police chief and other officials said. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte didn't comment publicly on the incident Friday.

Nonetheless, suspicions remain that the attack and fire were the handiwork of terrorists. As the incident was unfolding, U.S. President Donald Trump, in opening remarks in the nationally televised declaration of his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, referred to the incident as a terrorist attack.

The Philippines is battling Islamic State-linked militants in the southern city of Marawi, where the fighters invaded more than a week ago to prevent the arrest of a terror suspect.

Citizens from Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other countries have died in the conflict, stirring concern that, as Islamic State loses territory in Syria and Iraq, growing numbers of foreign militants are joining the long-running Muslim separatist insurgency in the southern part of the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines.

Scores of people have died in the conflict, including civilians and 10 Philippine troops who were killed in a friendly fire incident on Wednesday.

Islamic State said its fighters were responsible for the loss of life at the Resorts World casino in a brief Arabic statement posted on Islamic State's Amaq media arm. It used the plural form of the term, contradicting Philippine authorities' insistence that there was just one attacker.

In a subsequent statement, the terror group identified a single participant with the nom de guerre Abu al-Khayr al-Arkabili, SITE Intelligence Group reported.

World News: Philippines Struggles With Rebels --- Military accidentally kills 11 soldiers in bombing of Islamist bastion of Marawi

Philippine troops accidentally killed 11 of their comrades as they battled Islamist militants, the latest in a series of incidents illustrating how the military is struggling to contain the threat of rebel groups.

Soldiers are fighting street by street in the southern city of Marawi with the Muslim-extremist Maute group, which raised the black Islamic State flag there more than a week ago after authorities attempted and failed to arrest the leader of an allied faction.

The friendly fire incident announced Thursday, in which an airstrike Wednesday used unguided ordnance after the military ran short of guided missiles, came as the government said eight of the militants killed in fighting there were citizens of Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other foreign countries. That announcement bolstered fears that the complexion of the Philippines' militant uprising was becoming increasingly international, as Islamic State, also known as ISIS, loses territory in Iraq and Syria.

The threat is all the more severe given the longstanding failure of the Philippine military to eradicate the many extremist groups that recruit from the poor, marginalized Muslim communities in the jungles of the southern island of Mindanao. The region, which includes Marawi, has spawned and supported myriad insurgencies dating back to at least the 1970s. Successive governments have promised to bring peace to Mindanao, but none have.

Security experts fear that disparate extremists are coalescing in Mindanao under the Islamic State banner, establishing themselves in a country with a weak rule of law, thriving illegal arms trade and ready supply of brutal criminal factions.

"It's not just Mindanao per se that is threatened," said Kumar Ramakrishna, a security expert at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. The rest of Southeast Asia "could well be targeted for both recruitment and attacks against Western and allied interests."

The Philippine military has received training and advice from foreign powers such as the U.S. and Australia, but is ill-equipped to deal with such a complex threat, analysts say.

Wednesday's deadly mishap increases by about half the government's casualties in the battle for Marawi, now at least 31. The incident also undermines the military's reassurances to civilians, told for more than a week that they are safe from its "precision" airstrikes and mortar fire.

"While we mourn the loss of our valued men, we will attend to their bereaved families and provide comfort and solace to them during this trying time," the armed forces said in a statement.

Many of the extremist fighters involved in clashes with the military, meanwhile, live to fight on. Of the estimated 500 fighters officials say occupied Marawi more than a week ago, many are thought to have slipped away, past military checkpoints.

Philippine troops accidentally killed 11 of their comrades as they battled Islamist militants, the latest in a series of incidents illustrating how the military is struggling to contain the threat of rebel groups.

Soldiers are fighting street by street in the southern city of Marawi with the Muslim-extremist Maute group, which raised the black Islamic State flag there more than a week ago after authorities attempted and failed to arrest the leader of an allied faction.

The friendly fire incident announced Thursday, in which an airstrike Wednesday used unguided ordnance after the military ran short of guided missiles, came as the government said eight of the militants killed in fighting there were citizens of Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other foreign countries. That announcement bolstered fears that the complexion of the Philippines' militant uprising was becoming increasingly international, as Islamic State, also known as ISIS, loses territory in Iraq and Syria.

The threat is all the more severe given the longstanding failure of the Philippine military to eradicate the many extremist groups that recruit from the poor, marginalized Muslim communities in the jungles of the southern island of Mindanao. The region, which includes Marawi, has spawned and supported myriad insurgencies dating back to at least the 1970s. Successive governments have promised to bring peace to Mindanao, but none have.

Security experts fear that disparate extremists are coalescing in Mindanao under the Islamic State banner, establishing themselves in a country with a weak rule of law, thriving illegal arms trade and ready supply of brutal criminal factions.

"It's not just Mindanao per se that is threatened," said Kumar Ramakrishna, a security expert at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. The rest of Southeast Asia "could well be targeted for both recruitment and attacks against Western and allied interests."

The Philippine military has received training and advice from foreign powers such as the U.S. and Australia, but is ill-equipped to deal with such a complex threat, analysts say.

Wednesday's deadly mishap increases by about half the government's casualties in the battle for Marawi, now at least 31. The incident also undermines the military's reassurances to civilians, told for more than a week that they are safe from its "precision" airstrikes and mortar fire.

The aircraft in the case, officials said, was a propeller-driven Marchetti S-260, a training and light-attack plane also made for civilian use.

"While we mourn the loss of our valued men, we will attend to their bereaved families and provide comfort and solace to them during this trying time," the armed forces said in a statement.

Many of the extremist fighters involved in clashes with the military, meanwhile, live to fight on. Of the estimated 500 fighters officials say occupied Marawi more than a week ago, many are thought to have slipped away, past military checkpoints. It isn't clear whether Isnilon Hapilon, the militant leader whose attempted arrest triggered the battle, has also escaped. Officials believe he may still be in Marawi.

The Philippines armed forces didn't reply to a request to comment on its capacity to defeat the militants. In a statement Thursday, the military said it "will take down every Maute-ISIS member that continue to desecrate the Islamic City and thwart the security forces from restoring peace and order in this part of Mindanao."

While the threat from extremist groups like the Maute is growing, no evidence exists that they and other groups pledging their allegiance to Islamic State have received direct instructions from Islamic State leaders in the Middle East. Experts say the link is instead aimed at attracting new followers.

Southeast Asia, home to about 40% of the world's Muslims, is at particular risk of further radicalization. That is especially true in places like Mindanao's Muslim areas, where entrenched poverty and poor education alienate citizens from the Philippines' Roman Catholic majority. The Philippines lacks any structured extremist rehabilitation program, shown to be effective in countries such as Indonesia and Singapore.

Fears are gathering that the militants in Mindanao will declare a caliphate if the government doesn't defeat them, a symbolic move that could attract attention and followers even though they lack the numbers to permanently hold a meaningful area.

World News: Russian Cruise Missiles Strike  ISIS  Sites in Syria

Russia launched four cruise missiles at Islamic State targets in Syria from a warship and submarine in the Mediterranean, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

The launches hit sites to the west of Palmyra, which Russian-backed Syrian regime forces and Iranian-backed militias recaptured from Islamic State in March.

Wednesday's strike destroyed all targets, which included heavy weapons and fighters that had been deployed there from Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa, the Defense Ministry said.

The ministry said U.S., Turkish and Israeli military commanders had been informed about the launches "at the appropriate time."

"We are aware of the reports of Russian cruise missiles, but have no further information to provide," Col. Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition.

The Syrian regime had lost control of the ancient city of Palmyra to the extremist militants for a second time in December as its forces and allies were focused on battling antigovernment rebels in the northern city of Aleppo.

Since regaining control of Palmyra, Syrian forces have continued to advance eastward through the desert controlled by Islamic State.

The push toward the Iraqi border has put the regime and Iranian-backed forces on a collision course with U.S.-backed rebels who are also battling against Islamic State.

In May, the U.S.-led coalition launched airstrikes on those pro-regime forces as they neared the rebels in al-Tanf, near the borders with Iraq and Jordan.

It was only the second time the U.S. launched a deliberate strike against the Syrian regime and came after the coalition said it had warned the pro-regime forces to stop their advance.

The regime has lost most of its territorial control in eastern Syria, maintaining a foothold in only a few large cities.

As the regime has continued to rack up victories against rebels, it has turned more attention to fighting Islamic State, in part as a bid to underscore its long-held narrative that it is fighting terrorism.

Life & Arts -- Art: Antiquities Dealers Probed --- Ali and Hicham Aboutaam are under scrutiny as authorities in multiple countries look into looting by Islamic State

In early March, Swiss law-enforcement officials pulled over a vehicle on a Geneva road and, after a search, discovered an ancient oil lamp, people familiar with the matter say. When the driver failed to provide documentation proving the object's provenance to the officers' satisfaction, he was arrested on suspicion of evading value-added taxes, these people say.

The arrest accelerated an investigation that authorities hope can shed light on one of the art world's best-kept secrets: how ancient objects plundered in the battle zones of the Middle East end up in posh art collections thousands of miles away.

The driver, who hasn't been identified publicly or charged, works for Ali Aboutaam, the elder brother of one of the most storied families in the international antiquities business, which owns galleries off New York's Madison Avenue and in Geneva, according to Swiss authorities.

The Swiss say they already had the driver under surveillance when they made the stop, and that it was merely a step in a broader investigation of Mr. Aboutaam and his brother Hicham into whether they have handled Syrian and Iraqi objects looted under the auspices of the extremist group Islamic State, or ISIS.

In separate investigations, law enforcement in Belgium and security services in France are also looking at the brothers in connection with the ISIS looting, officials in these countries say.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is scrutinizing the Aboutaam brothers as part of an investigation into a number of U.S.-based antiquities dealers to determine whether they trafficked in looted material, according to people familiar with the matter.

Neither of the Aboutaam brothers has been charged with any wrongdoing related to these investigations. A lawyer representing the family company, Phoenix Ancient Art SA, said it "has never knowingly purchased or sold any looted items, let alone items looted by ISIS."

The lawyer, Jeremy H. Temkin, added: "Phoenix prides itself on its outstanding research of the provenance of items it buys and sells, its extensive due diligence, and its efforts to enhance transparency in the market."

The illegal trade in ancient coins, statues and relics has long been a vital source of funds for Islamic State, security officials say.

In December 2016, the Justice Department for the first time filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of objects associated with ISIS, alleging that the group markets and sells antiquities to finance its terror operations.

The items, which include a gold ring with a gemstone and a carved Neo-Assyrian stone depicting a eunuch, are believed to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, the Justice Department said. Photographs of the items were discovered during a raid of a top ISIS official's home near Deir Ezzour, Syria, in 2015 according to the complaint, filed in Washington federal court. As is typical of a civil forfeiture case, the lawsuit named the pieces themselves as defendants, and it isn't known who currently possesses them. No dealers have been implicated in the case.

The U.S., and particularly New York, is a major destination for stolen antiquities, American and European investigators say. More than 40% of the world's art is traded in the U.S., according to Arts Economics, a leading consultancy on art markets.

"It's still surprisingly easy to smuggle stolen objects here," said Domenic DiGiovanni, who handled more than 60 antiquities seizures as a customs officer in New York before retiring in 2014.

A 1970 United Nations convention banned all trade in antiquities taken without proper disclosure to the country in which they were found. In 2015, amid reports of widespread looting by Islamic State, the UN Security Council banned all trade in Syrian antiquities and reaffirmed a 1990s ban on sales of Iraqi artifacts.

Authorities in Switzerland were interested in the Aboutaam family even before the driver's arrest in March, and had already placed Ali Aboutaam's wife under surveillance, people familiar with the matter said. After the March car search, law-enforcement officials secretly watched as the wife, Biliana Voden Aboutaam, moved antiquities out of storage at the Geneva free ports -- a maze of armored warehouses in the city's industrial zone where people can legitimately store high-value items without having to pay tax on them, these people said.

Ms. Aboutaam was detained in early March for around two weeks after also failing to produce the proper documentation of ownership and origin for some objects. She was ultimately released without being charged.

After his arrest in Geneva, the driver told investigators that he had traveled several times to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, carrying small antiquities in his hand luggage, and that a person working with the Aboutaams was there to greet him, according to the people familiar with the probe.

"The situation involving Ali Aboutaam's driver and wife pertains to the local VAT and is unrelated to any matters relating to alleged looting," their lawyer, Mr. Temkin, said.

A spokesman for the Geneva free ports said he wasn't aware of the investigation into the Aboutaams and said the facility has tightened control of antiquities entering its storage space.

The Aboutaams' father, Sleiman, founded the family trading business, Phoenix Ancient Art, in Beirut in the 1960s. The brothers, Lebanese nationals with Canadian citizenship, inherited the business when their parents died in a plane crash in 1998.

Hicham and Ali Aboutaam have attracted attention from authorities in the past. A 2003 ICE investigation found they were "allegedly trafficking in illegally obtained art and antiquities," according to the U.S. agency's website. The following year, Hicham Aboutaam was fined $5,000 in New York federal court after pleading guilty to falsifying a customs declaration that declared a drinking vessel Syrian when it was alleged to have originated from a plundered Iranian cave, according to court records.

A spokesman for the Aboutaams said the artwork was purchased in good faith and there is no evidence it was stolen or illegally excavated. The incorrect description was the result of a clerical error, he added.

In 2004, an Egyptian court sentenced Ali Aboutaam in absentia to 15 years in prison after he was accused of smuggling artifacts from Egypt to Switzerland. In a news release, Phoenix said Mr. Aboutaam was never invited to participate in the proceedings and learned about his conviction from the press.

According to written statements by Bulgarian authorities, the Egyptian conviction led to his arrest in Sofia, Bulgaria, under an international warrant in 2008. A spokesman for Phoenix said a ruling that year in the Sofia High Court had exonerated Ali Aboutaam and deemed the Egyptian accusations as "false."

Egypt's antiquities authority didn't respond to a request for comment.

Last January, customs officials in Belgium seized Syrian objects that had been sent from the Aboutaams' Geneva gallery, according to a Belgian official and the spokesman of the Brussels Antiques & Fine Art Fair, where the art was heading.

The Belgian official said authorities are investigating whether they were excavated after the outbreak of Syria's civil war rather than in 1956, as the art dealer's documents claim.

In an email, Ali Aboutaam said the seizure was due to "malicious information" from a jealous Parisian art dealer and that both artifacts were traded before the war.

The Aboutaams are on a list of 15 dealers, including three based in the U.S., that French security officials are focusing on in connection with possible trading in antiquities looted by ISIS, according to a document seen by the Journal and to two people familiar with the probes.

French authorities are gathering information on what artifacts the Aboutaams and others sell, as well as on their suppliers, clients and international banking transactions, officials say.

The Aboutaams' U.S. gallery is located on a street off Madison Avenue. Visitors are buzzed into a discreetly lit stone-floored room where around 24 unlabeled objects are displayed with prices that are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The brothers say they have sold pieces to some of the world's biggest museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The Met declined to comment. The Getty Museum said it "acquired one object in its collection from Phoenix Ancient Art, more than 20 years ago."

U.S. Veteran Convicted of Terrorism Gets 35 Years in Prison; Tairod Pugh was government's first trial victory against an Islamic State sympathizer

A U.S. veteran who sought to fight for Islamic State in Syria was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison, the maximum possible sentence.

"The defendant broke his oath to defend our nation and instead made repeated attempts to join ISIL on the battlefield of Syria," said in a statement James P. O'Neill, commissioner of the New York City Police Department.

Tairod Pugh, a 49-year-old U.S. citizen, was convicted last year in what was the government's first trial victory against an Islamic State sympathizer.

His lawyer said she intends to appeal the conviction.

"This is a guy who never had any contact" with terrorists, defense lawyer Susan Kellman said Wednesday, reached by telephone.

"He served his country bravely," Ms. Kellman said, pointing to Mr. Pugh's military service and his contract work for the military over the years.

Ms. Kellman asked the court that Mr. Pugh serves his sentence in Butner, N.C., to be close to family.

The son of a career Air Force officer, Mr. Pugh lived on military bases in the U.S. and Europe for much of his youth, according to court documents. He joined the Air Force in 1986, at age 18. As a mechanic during his four-year enlistment, Mr. Pugh learned to install and maintain aircraft engines, navigation and weapons systems. He later worked as an airplane mechanic for several companies in the U.S. and Middle East.

Government officials said Mr. Pugh, who had been living in Egypt, flew to Turkey on a one-way ticket in January 2015. His intention, they said, was to cross the border into Syria to join Islamic State, a well-known route for radicalized Westerners. As evidence, they pointed at material retrieved from his laptop and other devices, including downloaded Islamic State videos, online searches for terms like "borders controlled by Islamic State" and a letter addressed to his wife in which he declared his intention to become a martyr for Islamic State.

At Least 90 Killed in Blast Near Embassies in Afghan Capital; Explosion strikes near U.S. military headquarters in Kabul's Green Zone

KABUL— truck packed with explosives detonated in the heart of the Afghan capital on Wednesday, killing at least 90 people as the country reels from an escalating militant campaign that is ramping up pressure on the Trump administration over how to counter the violence.

The massive blast struck during the morning rush hour on the outskirts of a heavily fortified part of the city known as the Green Zone where major embassies and U.S. military headquarters are located. It was the first time a truck bomb had struck in the area, and it collapsed buildings, blew out glass windows and sent a mushroom cloud of smoke over the city.

The Afghan intelligence agency blamed the Haqqani network, a militant group that is part of the Taliban insurgency. Afghan and foreign officials often blame the network for high-profile attacks in the capital, but the group rarely issues public statements or makes claims. The Taliban denied responsibility for the bombing; the Taliban typically avoids claiming attacks that kill many civilians.

Hospitals were flooded with victims of the attack, which wounded more than 400 people. The vast majority were Afghan civilians who had been commuting to work at government agencies, companies and foreign embassies on foot or in buses. The death toll from the blast was expected to rise as more bodies were discovered in the debris and collapsed buildings.

"When we come to the office, we don't know if we'll come back," said Ekramuddin Hamdard, an employee of an Afghan telecom company who spoke from his bed at Kabul's Emergency Hospital, where he was being treated for a head wound. "Every day is death for us," he added.

The blast came a week before the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani is to host a gathering of representatives of more than 20 countries to discuss political solutions to the long-running conflict with the Taliban.

It also came amid debate in the administration of President Donald Trump over the direction of U.S. policy in Afghanistan. The bombing would appear unlikely to alter that debate, though it may intensify it, one administration official said.

The Pentagon has recommended sending an additional 3,000—r possibly as many as 5,000—.S. troops to combat militant groups and assist the Afghan military. White House officials say it could be weeks before a final proposal is sent to the president for a decision.

Mr. Trump called Mr. Ghani on Wednesday to express his "deepest condolences," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.

The Taliban, which has waged war against the U.S.-backed government for 16 years, has carried out increasingly devastating attacks in the capital since most foreign troops withdrew in 2014, with the goal of turning Afghans against the government by creating an impression of unmanageable chaos and instability.

The group has also taken advantage of the vacuum left by foreign troops to seize swaths of territory and threaten at least half a dozen major cities.

The Pentagon fears that territorial losses by the Afghan government could allow foreign terrorists to use Afghanistan as a haven, as it did when the Taliban government hosted late former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S.

There was no immediate response to the attack from the Taliban's Islamist rival, the local branch of Islamic State, which in the past year has expanded its operations beyond its stronghold in eastern Nangarhar province and carried out large attacks in Kabul. Islamic State cooperates with the Taliban in some parts of Afghanistan but has clashed with them in others, as they compete for territory.

Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which are embroiled in fights against violent religious extremists, have been hit by a spate of attacks since the start of Ramadan on Saturday. The holy month is a time of prayer and spiritual reflection for many Muslims, who fast during daylight hours. But some extremist groups such as Islamic State claim killing enemies is a noble act during the period.

With the Taliban and Islamic State turning increasingly to vehicle-borne bombs, Afghan and foreign officials have been bracing for the possibility of a large assault on Kabul's busy center.

Emergency Hospital, itself damaged in the blast, received more than a hundred victims in the first half-hour after the attack, officials there said.

Relatives cried outside the gates, while others scoured lists of casualties for names of family members and friends.

Afghans working for government agencies, media organizations and foreign embassies were among the dead in the rush-hour explosion. They included 10 Afghan security personnel working for the U.S. government, according to an internal U.S. State Department update. A driver for the Afghan service of the British Broadcasting Corp. was also killed.

Eleven U.S. citizens working as contractors in Kabul were injured, a State Department official said, adding that none of their injuries appeared life threatening.

An Afghan guard at the German embassy was killed and German diplomatic staff were injured in the explosion, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said. The blast destroyed the outer walls of the compound and caused severe damage to the buildings inside.

"I was in the makeup room preparing for my morning show. A huge boom shook the room and everything collapsed. It was terrible," said Taban Ibraz, an anchor for Afghan television network 1TV, located near the blast. "The entire studio, newsroom and offices have been destroyed."

An employee of Roshan, a mobile phone company, said many of his colleagues were killed and wounded in the blast. "The two floors of office building collapsed completely as a result of the explosion," he said. Then, the "office's generators caught fire as well."

Wednesday's carnage marked the first major attack on Kabul since March, when Islamic State fighters disguised as doctors broke into a military hospital and massacred scores of people. The final death toll of that assault remains unknown, but Afghan and foreign officials have said more than 100 may have been killed.

In addition to calling for the deployment of more U.S. troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has proposed that U.S. forces be allowed to target the Taliban directly on their own. Currently, under procedures approved during the administration of former President Barack Obama, the U.S. can strike the militant group only in joint raids with Afghan forces.

There are currently 8,500 U.S. troops in the country, along with 6,500 troops representing members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

World News: Car Bombings Kill Dozens in Baghdad --- Attacks come days after Iraqi military steps up campaign against Islamic State

BAGHDAD -- Two car bombings in the Iraqi capital early Tuesday killed at least two dozen people and injured 60 others, Iraqi officials said, in attacks that targeted families during the holy month of Ramadan.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for a blast outside a popular ice-cream shop in Baghdad just after midnight that Iraqi officials said killed at least 14 people and injured 30 others. The Sunni extremist group said it sought to kill Shiites in the Karrada neighborhood, which has been targeted by major bombings in the past.

In a separate attack, hours after the ice-cream shop explosion, a car bomb was detonated outside the main pension office in Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and injuring around 30, Iraqi officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the bombing.

The attacks came days after the Iraqi military began another phase of the campaign against Islamic State militants in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul after months of brutal house-to-house combat.

"The Daesh terrorist group attacks people during Ramadan days, this is evidence of how evil this group is," Interior Minister Qassim al-Araji said, using another name for Islamic State. "Everything has a price and this is the price of freedom," he said.

The holy month of Ramadan is a time of prayer and spiritual reflection for many Muslims, who fast during daylight hours. Some extremist groups such as Islamic State, however, claim killing enemies is noble and more worthy during the period.

Iraqis usually spend time with family and friends during Ramadan, often crowding restaurants and cafes late into the night after breaking their fasts.

The Faqma ice-cream shop is a popular destination for families and couples in the Iraqi capital.

Unconfirmed social-media posts in the aftermath of the bombing showed children weeping as they wandered through flaming rubble. Bloodstained sidewalks outside the shop were littered with pink ice-cream cups dropped in the melee.

"ISIS terrorists tonight in Baghdad target children & families enjoying time together at an ice cream shop," Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the coalition fighting Islamic State said in a tweet soon after the bombing. "We stand w/Iraq against this evil."

High-profile bombings like the ice-cream parlor attack are interspersed with other, smaller blasts that happen almost daily in Baghdad. They are a reminder of Islamic State's ability to terrorize people in enclaves of the nation's capital that were thought to be protected.

In July 2016, Islamic State claimed a truck bombing that killed more than 300 people in the Karrada neighborhood, many of them trapped by fire in a shopping mall as they prepared for celebrations marking the end of Ramadan. The huge blast, which took place before the launch of the offensive against Islamic State to push them from their Iraqi stronghold of Mosul, had raised questions about security inside the Iraqi capital.

Though they have all but lost Mosul, Islamic State still controls pockets of territory in the country, including some smaller towns.

After Mosul is retaken, the Iraqi military and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are expected to turn to those areas to drive the militant group from Iraq.

World
One Family's Toll in Egypt Attack: 7 Dead; They were among 30 people killed when  ISIS  gunmen attacked a tour bus south of Cairo on Friday

CAIRO—or Samia Morkous and her family, the trip to a Coptic Christian monastery was meant as a pilgrimage of gratitude for her husband's recovery from lung surgery. Then Islamic State gunmen ambushed the tour bus south of Cairo.

Her son, Sameh, opened the door of the small bus and then recoiled and fell back from shots to his head, said Mrs. Morkous. Several gunmen boarded the bus and demanded that the occupants recite the Muslim creed.

Those who refused—r who answered with Christian hymns—ere immediately killed, Mrs. Morkous said at a Cairo hospital where she is recovering from bullet wounds to her thighs suffered in the Friday attack.

When it was over, Mrs. Morkous's husband, Mohsen; two adult sons; a teenage grandson; a four-year-old granddaughter; and two other relatives were among 30 people killed.

"We came to get blessings and rejoice with our children," Mrs. Morkous, who lives in Tinley Park, Ill., said of the trip to the ancient St. Samuel Monastery.

"It was like the world flipped upside down around us," she said of the attack.

The couple were on their first trip to Egypt in nearly two years, after immigrating to the U.S. several years ago.

Mr. Morkous had successfully recovered from lung surgery and recently became a naturalized American citizen. He worked at a nephew's hair salon in Country Club Hills, Ill., said Reverend Samuel Azmy, his priest at the St. George Coptic Orthodox Church. Mrs. Morkous, who is 56, holds a green card.

The ambush in Minya province, about 190 miles south of Cairo, was the deadliest terrorist attack ever on Egypt's Coptic Christian minority. It marked the latest in a series of Islamic State attacks on Copts since December, including three bombings of Coptic churches that killed 70 people.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, facing increasing criticism from Copts who say he has failed to protect them, ordered rare cross-border airstrikes on militant camps in Libya in the wake of the attack.

The strikes were aimed at the Libyan city of Derna. Forces headed by a Sisi ally, Gen. Khalifa Haftar, say the city is home to armed groups linked to al Qaeda, but not Islamic State, which was driven out in 2015.

On Tuesday, the Libyan National Army said it had set up an operations room to coordinate airstrikes with Egypt. Spokesmen for both militaries declined to give more detail on the arrangement, including whether Egypt had launched any additional airstrikes after the initial round.

A spokesman for Mr. Sisi also didn't respond to messages and calls seeking comment. Mr. Sisi, in a televised speech following the Friday attack, said the gunmen had trained in unspecified militant camps in Libya.

Visitors to Mrs. Morkous's hospital room kissed her hand, asking for her blessings and offering condolences. They told her that her family members were in a better place and marveled at an interview she gave to a local television station in which she said she is praying for the murderers.

She recalled the attack in a low voice and short sentences punctuated by deep breaths. "There was heavy gunfire," she said.

In an effort to save a relative who had a gun pointed at him, Mrs. Morkous said she removed her gold jewelry and handed it to a gunman. He shot her family member anyway.

Tipping Over Trump? As voting begins in Georgia, Democrats wonder if their candidate can be taken seriously.

Early voting is underway today in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, where Democrats figure they finally enjoy favorable terrain to score a victory in a special election. It's their candidate that has them worried.

To this point, the anti-Trump "resistance" has been more successful in drawing media attention than in winning elections or raising money. Since Donald Trump's stunning victory in November, Democrats have lost a run-off election for a U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana as well as open races for U.S. House seats in Kansas and Montana. The donkeys have suffered a further shellacking when it comes to raising money. The Republican National Committee ended April with a cash-on-hand advantage of more than $30 million over its Democratic counterpart, notes the Washington Examiner.

But Democrats have been spending a lot in the Georgia contest to replace former Rep. Tom Price, who is now President Trump's health secretary. The district, which will be voting through June 20, has been reliably Republican for decades. But it's the kind of upscale suburb where voters have never fully embraced Mr. Trump, though they gave him slightly more votes than Hillary Clinton in November. Hoping to capitalize on concerns about the President but mindful of the area's voting history, Democrats are presenting 30-year-old Jon Ossoff as a social liberal and fiscal moderate. He's promising to work across the aisle on issues like tax reform. Mr. Ossoff is facing Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia Secretary of State.

But more than Ms. Handel, it seems to be their own candidate that Democrats fear most. Specifically, they are hoping that district residents can be persuaded to vote early before thinking too much about whether Mr. Ossoff is up to the job. The Washington Postreports, "Now more than ever, some party strategists fear that if he cannot put the race away ahead of June 20, late-breaking voters will not view him as a serious enough alternative in these politically turbulent times."

Now why would strategists in his own party suspect that voters won't take him seriously? According to his statement on his campaign website, Mr. Ossoff is a very serious man indeed:

I lead a company that investigates corrupt politicians and organized crime.

Our team has taken down human traffickers, exposed dozens of corrupt officials around the world, and uncovered atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq. Previously, I was a senior national security staffer in the U.S. Congress, working with our military and intelligence community to keep Georgians safe while investigating wrongdoing by government contractors.

Mr. Ossoff adds that "as a Congressional aide, I learned how to get things done in Washington. On Capitol Hill and as a journalist, I've learned how to expose and fight the abuse of power."

It sounds like quite a compelling resume to assemble by the age of 30, especially when one learns that Mr. Ossoff also found time to squeeze in a master's degree.

The Atlanta Journal Constitutiondiscovered that one reason Mr. Ossoff leads his company, which makes documentary films, is that he used an inheritance to buy it—r at least a part of it. "I'm involved intimately in every phase of production," he tells the paper. Yet while the production company's website duly notes his titles of CEO and managing director, as of this writing it doesn't mention his name in a description of the company's various film projects.

And then there's Mr. Ossoff's rendering of his congressional career. The friendly liberal confines of Politifact rated as "half true" his statement at a campaign event that "I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress."

Mr. Ossoff had included in the "five years" his part-time work while a student at Georgetown. During this period he was a "legislative correspondent," which typically means a drafter of form letters to constituents. But his employer at the time, Rep. Hank Johnson, (D., Ga.) assures Politifact that even though Mr. Ossoff was a junior aide, "to say that Jon staffed me on national security, that's entirely, 100 percent correct."

It's the shorter period during which Mr. Ossoff really was a full-time aide to a Member of Congress that might be most interesting to the voters of Georgia's Sixth District. Politifact says that Mr. Ossoff became Mr. Johnson's "senior legislative assistant" in January of 2010. While veterans of Capitol Hill might question whether a college kid working part time would be trusted as a lawmaker's principal aide on national security, there seems to be no argument that by 2010 Mr. Ossoff was firmly in charge of this portfolio for Mr. Johnson.

Among the most important responsibilities of such a job is to ensure that the lawmaker is well prepared for hearings of the House Armed Services Committee, on which Mr. Johnson sat at the time. Ideally, staff will provide useful background, prepare a compelling opening statement for the lawmaker to read and also draft a list of suggested questions to elicit valuable information. At the very least, the job of staff is to prevent the lawmaker from looking like he's not on top of the relevant issues.

That bar proved to be a little too high on March 25, 2010 when Mr. Johnson, presumably staffed by Mr. Ossoff, had an exchange with Admiral Robert Willard, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command. Here's an excerpt from the transcript, in which they discuss the Pacific island of Guam:

JOHNSON: This is an island that, at its widest level is, what, 12 miles from shore to shore? And at its smallest level or smallest location, it's seven miles between one shore and the other. Is that correct?

WILLARD: I don't have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.

JOHNSON: A very small island and about 24 miles, if I recall, long. So 24 miles long, about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the island and about 12 miles wide on the widest part of the island. And I don't know how many square miles that is. Do you happen to know?

WILLARD: I don't have that figure with me, sir. I can certainly supply it to you if you'd like.

JOHNSON: Yes. My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.

WILLARD: We don't anticipate that.

With more than 673,000 views on Youtube, the video from this 2010 hearing could rank among the most popular films that Mr. Ossoff has ever produced.

It's not the only part of his record that voters in the Atlanta suburbs might want to consider. The Almanac of American Politics reports that Rep. Johnson has a "solidly liberal voting record" and is even more liberal on economic issues than on social ones. Is it reasonable to expect that his former aide will now chart a very different course?

The larger question is how much voters of Georgia's Sixth District are willing to pay to send Donald Trump a message. It seems that Democratic strategists don't want voters to spend too much time thinking about the answer.

Bottom Stories of the Day will return on Wednesday.

France Directs Kills of French Fighters in  ISIS

French special forces have for months enlisted Iraqi soldiers to hunt and kill French nationals who have joined the senior ranks of Islamic State, according to Iraqi officers and current and former French officials.

Iraqi commanders leading the fight for Mosul said French special forces have provided to Iraqi counterterrorism troops the names and photographs of as many as 30 men identified as high-value targets. An undisclosed number of French citizens have been killed by Iraqi artillery and ground forces, the commanders said, using location coordinates and other intelligence supplied by the French.

The motive for the secret operation is to ensure that French nationals with allegiance to Islamic State never return home to threaten France with a terror attack, said a current and a former foreign-affairs adviser to the French government. France has been the target of several deadly attacks either inspired by Islamic State or orchestrated from the militants' Middle East strongholds, including the November 2015 Paris strikes.

A French Ministry of Defense spokeswoman declined to comment on the operation. "French forces work in close cooperation with their Iraqi and international partners," she said, to fight jihadists, "regardless of national origin," referring to the 1,200 French troops assisting Iraqi forces to retake Mosul.

The French special forces maintain their distance from the killings -- France has no death penalty -- by directing Iraqi fighters to target French Islamic State fighters, according to the current and former French government advisers.

A senior Iraqi police official showed The Wall Street Journal a list of names of 27 suspected Islamic State members sought by France, accompanied by photos of five of the men. French special forces began circulating the document at the start of the Mosul offensive last year. It is updated as men are killed, the police official said.

One man was identified on the list as "Badush," and the document described him as last seen in July driving a white Kia in northern Mosul, wearing traditional Iraqi clothing. Several of the names included aliases that linked the men to France -- Abu Ismael al-Fransi and Abu Souleyman al-Fransi -- or to Belgium, where some of the Paris attackers were from. Belgium's Defense Ministry declined to comment.

France doesn't have armed drones, so government officials sent its elite forces into Mosul to locate French militants, a Western security official said.

About 40 French special forces operate state-of-the-art intelligence-gathering tools, such as surveillance drones and radio interception devices, to help locate militants, said senior Iraqi counterterrorism officers and former and current French government officials.

"They are dealing with them here, because they don't want to deal with them at home," said a senior Iraqi counterterrorism officer directly involved in coordinating with the French special forces. "It's their duty. It's common sense. The most lethal attacks overseas were in France."

Iraqi government officials said their military doesn't participate in systematic extrajudicial killing of Islamic State fighters, and any such cases would be investigated for possible prosecution.

A spokesman for Iraq's Justice Ministry declined to say whether the government has any foreign Islamic State fighters in custody. Iraqi commanders have said most militants fight to the death.

"If anyone is alive, in jail, because they surrendered, they will be executed in Iraq for joining Islamic State. And France won't intervene," said a current French official familiar with the matter. "It's a convenient solution."

An estimated 1,700 Frenchmen have joined the militants in Iraq and Syria, according to the Soufan Group, a New York-based organization that researches extremism. French government officials have estimated that hundreds of those men have either died in battle or returned home.

Other Western countries have lists of their nationals in league with Islamic State. But only France is engaged in hunting them in Mosul, Iraqi officers said.

France debated the legality of targeting its citizens when it joined the U.S. bombing campaign in Syria in the fall of 2015. An October airstrike that year apparently killed French militants near Raqqa, and the government sought to tamp down criticism at home by citing a provision in the United Nations charter that allows member states to use any means of "legitimate defense" if under attack.

France's laws and constitution offer little protection to citizens who take up arms with militant groups to fight the government, said Michel Verpeaux, a professor of constitutional law at the Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne in Paris.

"The French are fighting not a state but an armed group," Mr. Verpeaux said. "It's a highly uncertain situation with few legal rules."

France has talked about stripping nationals of citizenship for joining terror groups to bar their return home, as the U.K. has, a proposal that met stiff resistance in parliament.

Dozens of French nationals fighting with Islamic State have been killed in the battle for Mosul, two Iraqi officers said. The seven-month offensive by Iraqi forces and international allies is close to driving the remaining Islamic State fighters from the western part of Mosul, the militants' last major holding in Iraq.

French special forces often move through Mosul without Iraqi military partners. They search homes abandoned by foreign militants, as well as command centers in search of physical evidence or documents that link their citizens to Islamic State, two senior Iraqi counterterrorism officers said.

In April, French special forces swept through a medical clinic near the Mosul University campus, checking the identities of the wounded against their list of French nationals working for Islamic State. The French forces, often wearing Iraqi uniforms and driving vehicles with Iraqi military logos, are particularly concerned about any chemical-weapons specialists working on the campus, according to a senior Iraqi commander who coordinated with French forces.

Mosul University was used by Islamic State as a command center until Iraqi forces recaptured the campus in January, the Iraqi commander said.

The French special forces have a forensics team that collects physical evidence -- tissue and bone from the dead and wounded, as well as discarded drinking cups and utensils -- to find DNA matches with the men on their wanted list, Iraqi and French officials said.

The team in one instance collected bone samples from a dead fighter and ran the DNA collected through a database to compare with the DNA of French nationals suspected of joining Islamic State, according to the former foreign-affairs adviser to the French government.

A team of four French special forces went door to door in the neighborhood in January. Two of the soldiers checked the identities of residents while the other two men stood guard. "They have their own targets," an Iraqi counterterrorism officer said as he passed the scene.

French special forces have recently focused on Republic Hospital, a large complex in Mosul's Old City, according to two Iraqi Army officers who worked with them. The Old City, a warren of densely populated streets and alleys, is a commercial center and the last district in Mosul controlled by militants.

The French forces suspect that the remaining high-level Islamic State commanders, including some Frenchmen, are holed up at the hospital.

World News: McCain Sees Russia As Bigger Threat To U.S. Than  ISIS

CANBERRA, Australia -- Russia is a bigger security threat than Islamic State, based on its willingness to challenge the democratic foundations of the U.S. by interfering in elections, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said during a visit to Australia.

Mr. McCain, who was in Australia to discuss Asia-Pacific security issues, said Russian President Vladimir Putin was the premier challenge to American security.

"I think ISIS can do terrible things and I worry a lot about what is happening with the Muslim faith," he told Australian ABC state television on Monday. "But it's the Russians who tried to destroy the very fundamental of democracy, and that is to change the outcome of an American election."

Mr. McCain recently walked back comments that the controversy surrounding investigations into potential collusion between associates of President Donald Trump and the Russian government had reached "Watergate size and scale," saying he had seen no evidence Russia had succeeded in swaying the U.S. presidential-election process. "But they tried and they are still trying," he said.

The visit by the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee was part of an Asia tour to outline a blueprint for the U.S. to invest nearly $8 billion bulking up its military presence in the region by upgrading infrastructure, conducting additional exercises and deploying more forces and ships.

Mr. McCain's visit also was aimed at reassuring allies about U.S. willingness to remain engaged in Asia, both as a check against China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea and on North Korea's nuclear program.

After North Korea fired another short-range ballistic missile off its east coast on Monday, Mr. McCain said unless something could be done to restrain Pyongyang's ambitions, the crisis could escalate along the lines of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union came close to nuclear conflict.

"What's the best and easiest way [to deal with the situation]? Obviously the Chinese, because the Chinese control basically the North Korean economy," Mr. McCain said. "We have to explain to the Chinese how this is a vital issue. We need their help and cooperation."

President Donald Trump : The recent attack on Manchester in the United Kingdom demonstrates the depths of the evil we face with terrorism. All people who cherish life must unite in finding, exposing, and removing these killers and extremists.

Paul Gigot: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm Paul Gigot.

That was President Trump in Brussels on Thursday addressing fellow NATO leaders and calling for a united front in fighting terrorism following this week's deadly bombing at a concert in Manchester, England. The Islamic State took credit for that attack carried out by a 22-year-old British-born Muslim who recently returned from a three-week trip to Libya and may have had ISIS training.

The assault came just one day after President Trump addressed Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia, urging them to drive out the terrorists and extremists in their midst.

Trump: Drive them out. Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your Holy Land. And drive them out of this earth.

Gigot: Joining the panel this week, "Wall Street Journal" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; editorial board member, Mary Kissel; and columnist, Bill McGurn.

So, Bill, let's take a look at the whole trip. What do you think? Success or not, this first excursion abroad?

Bill McGurn: I think he's been largely successful in getting his message across. You know, the first part was the Middle East along with Rome, trying to get the three big religions on the same page on terrorism, an aggressive message. Now, the greatest gift to Donald Trump is Barack Obama.

Gigot: Especially in the Middle East, Israel and Saudi Arabia.

McGurn: Eight years without American leadership. He was there basically to say American leadership is back.

And, look, I think the cities are -- have changed, too. They recognize this threat against themselves. They're in a much different place than they were in --

Gigot: When you say the Sunnis, you mean the Sunni-Arab nations, like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the gulf states.

McGurn: But there was just an attack on Coptic Christians and so forth. They understand that they're not going to have a future unless they arrest this extremism and terrorism on their home soil.

Gigot: Mary, one of the big themes that the president offered for the Sunni-Arabs was, look, you need to take on the radicals in your midst yourselves. OK? We can't just do it. You have to root them out. That's not a message that I don't think any previous president has addressed that directly to Arab leaders.

Mary Kissel: Well, that's because the last president thought that terrorism was a war that needed to be resolved in the Muslim world, and Americans were simply collateral damage in that war. He didn't want to take a leading role. I think President Trump is doing well in sending that message that they need to be involved.

But he also made the point in Saudi Arabia, Paul, that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are Muslims themselves. And that's why they have an interest here. And, look, these nations know it. Saudi Arabia's fighting a war on its southern front in Yemen, fighting the Iran-backed Houthi militia. You have moderate nations like, for example, Israel, who are threatened to their north by what's going on in Syria. The nations of Europe understand this as well. They're dealing with refugees. So it's time to have this message come across.

Gigot: Go ahead, Dan.

Dan Henninger: You know, look, the press after this trip is making the point that when Donald Trump went to Brussels and NATO, that he didn't make a full-throated commitment to NATO and Article V. First --

Gigot: Which is what?

Henninger: Which is an attack on one is an attack on all.

Gigot: OK.

Henninger: As though the United States and Europe were now threatened by the Soviet Union coming through the gap in Germany.

No. The western world is threatened by Islamic State. Donald Trump made a campaign promise to get rid of the Islamic State. This trip was the beginning of assembling a strategy to do exactly that. First, he goes to Saudi Arabia, gets a commitment from the Saudis to create an Arab coalition to fight the Saudis (sic). We are going to work with Israel to that.

Gigot: To fight Islamic State.

Henninger: To fight Islamic State, I'm sorry. Then he goes to Brussels, and the secretary-general of NATO, Jan Stoltenberg, says we are now formally joining this coalition to fight Islamic State. This is done in the midst of the attack in Manchester. So I think it was a very successful trip. He's beginning to build a coalition to do exactly what the point of it was.

Gigot: What about the charge, and we've heard the criticism, that in tilting, going to Saudi Arabia and so overtly aligning with them, he's tilting too far to the Sunni-Arabs, and that ignores the Shiite -- the Persians and the Shiites in Iran, in particular, and that that's a strategic mistake.

Henninger: Once again let's roll the clock back 40 years, and if Iran were just sitting there pumping oil, whether it was under -- you know, the ayatollahs or under the shah, this would not -- that would be an issue. But Iran is now a centrifugal force trying to project itself and subsidizing terrorists in the rest of the Middle East. That's the Shiite problem.

McGurn: Iran is a thousands-year-old culture, a real nation with all this projection of power and surrogates and proxies.

Look, I think that the president -- it's welcome that the Sunni-Arabs now say we want America's leadership in the region. They haven't had it. And I think it was welcomed to go to NATO and shake them up. They don't pay their fair share, and they have been a little lax on terrorism. You know, General Keane was on FOX the other day --

Gigot: Jack Keane.

McGurn: -- and calling them feckless. I think he said 32 attacks in eight NATO countries, yet they won't commit ground troops to going after the centers of ISIS and so forth.

Gigot: Go ahead, Mary.

Kissel: It was also nice to see a little bit more discipline out of the president, too. He wasn't on his Twitter account. We didn't see scandals there. He was reading from the teleprompter. The message was clear, and I think it was consistent during the trip.

Gigot: But did he miss an opportunity to just say flat-out, look, I endorse Article V? His colleagues -- his aides were setting that up early. The Europeans were saying they were disappointed he didn't say that overtly, given the fact in the campaign he'd said NATO was obsolete. He's worked that back, no question. But did he miss an opportunity?

Kissel: What matters? Do words matter or do actions matter?

Gigot: Well, words matter.

Kissel: The president was there for the commemoration ceremony. He talked about the threat from Russia, which is why the NATO allies are worried, besides from terrorism. He is taking a leadership role. He dropped a bomb in Syria that Obama didn't do, couldn't do for years. He's taking action. So if they're worried about, you know, the rhetoric. I think they're worried about the wrong thing.

Gigot: Well, but, I mean, you do need to send a strong signal rhetorically to the Russians, it seems to me, don't go over that line.

Kissel: Well, he hasn't eased sanctions. He's talked about the Ukraine incursions. I'd say that's a pretty good signal.

Gigot: All right, thank you very much.

President Trump adopting an aggressive approach on his first trip abroad, reviving old alliances in the Middle East and sending a message to Iran.

Trump: Iran's leaders routinely call for Israel's destruction. Not with Donald J. Trump.

Trump: For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room.

Gigot: President Trump in Riyadh singling out Iran in his address to Arab leaders. That speech in Saudi Arabia kicked off the president's first foreign trip which culminated this weekend at the G-7 summit in Sicily.

Cliff May is the founder and president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He joins me now from Washington.

Cliff, welcome back. Good to see you.

Cliff May: Good to see you.

Gigot: So in the NATO -- I want to ask, first, about this NATO address where the leaders are all standing there, and the president really gets pretty blunt about saying you need to spend more money on defense. I don't think some of them liked it. I'm just reading from the body language and some of their comments later. What do you think of that challenge to those leaders?

May: I think it's a necessary challenge. They need to spend more. They also need to do more. Too many of our NATO allies do not have sufficient capabilities. Too many of the generals love hanging out in the more than billion dollar NATO center drinking espresso.

But they don't expect ever to see combat in their entire lives. Combat is so 19th century to them. We have real challenges and real threats, and NATO will become obsolete. I don't think it is, but will become obsolete if NATO doesn't face those challenges, and particularly the challenges represented by jihadism and Islamism, both in its Shia or Iranian form and its Sunni form.

Gigot: So you think it actually is an improvement that NATO's now announced it's going to join the coalition against Islamic State? That's clearly a response to Trump.

May: That is a response to Trump. Look, I think the -- it's clear that the European leaders were not pleased by Trump. They don't like him particularly.

Gigot: Right.

May: They see him as gauche. I think his job was to send them a very clear message that they can't be "free riders" -- and that's also a word Obama used. They can't simply use NATO to be protected by the U.S. while they disrespect the U.S. They have to participate in mutual self-defense or it's not really a mutual self-defense alliance.

Gigot: Do you think the press is making too much of this failure of the president to address specifically Article V, which was invoked once in NATO history. After 9/11, the NATO allies said after the attack on 9/11 this, they triggered Article V, and they joined us in the alliance to fight Afghanistan the Taliban. Do you think Trump should have stated more explicitly, look, I endorse that?

May: I think that would have been a reasonable thing to consider, but having said that, keep in mind he did mention Article V --

Gigot: Yes, he did.

May: -- and he praised Article V. That sends a pretty good signal that he hasn't deviated from Article V or nullified Article V. He still holds by it. But he didn't emphasize it as much as one might. But he also said -- and I think this is part of the carrots and stick approach -- you want me to be strong on protecting you, help me protect the free world, don't make it my job alone.

Gigot: Let's talk about the Middle East and especially that visit to Saudi Arabia where the president really, I think, took the biggest change of direction from President Obama in trying to revive the traditional alliance with the Sunni-Arabs. Yet, he's getting some criticism on that from some people who say, look, he was too hostile to Iran. What do you think the president was up to there, and how do you see this, how do you see this moving ahead with his policy in the Middle East?

May: First of all, he's being very clear that he intends to be the corrective for the policy of appeasement that President Obama undertook.

Gigot: Towards Iran.

May: Towards Iran. A total policy of appeasement towards Iran. Iran, the leading sponsor of terrorism in the world, according to our government, is getting a patient pathway to nuclear weapons and billions of dollars that it does and can use for military purposes, for intercontinental ballistic missiles, and to support terrorism. He's making it clear that he doesn't accept that, that appeasement is now off the table.

I think we've been talking a lot about the words, there's also symbolism, deep symbolism that I think was very effective when he has the leaders, or rulers to be more precise --

-- dozens of Sunni nations lined up behind him. That sends an important, symbolic message. When he flies, first president ever to do so, from Saudi Arabia to Israel, that sends a message. When he also, on the same trip, visits the Vatican, that sends an important message. And I think you have to give credit for these things. I think if this were a normal presidency, I think more journalists would.

Gigot: All right. What do you think about the arms sales to the Saudis? We're selling a lot of arms. And do you worry that that could potentially be a threat to Israeli security?

May: I do worry about that. The Israelis have been promised by the U.S. that they will maintain a qualitative military edge, and it's important that they do. I think the Israelis worry about it, but they're also not protesting it because they do know that the Saudis are very much on the front lines, that the Islamic Republic of Iran represents an existential threat not just to Israel, but also to the Saudis and the gulf -- and most of the gulf Sunni states. And, in fact, it's a more imminent threat represented by Iran. So they understand why the Saudis are going to have that. Israel needs to stay ahead of the game. This is a tricky maneuver. Everybody's walking on a tight rope. But at the end of the day, I think it is necessary.

And by the way, from a Trumpian perspective, selling lots of arms to the Saudis so they can help defend themselves, we don't have to defend them entirely. That's will be helping a lot. That's a good thing. And perhaps a lot of jobs coming out of these sales as well.

Gigot: Well, and moving towards a policy, it sounds to me like containment against Iran's regional ambitions even if he doesn't withdraw from the nuclear pact. Briefly, Cliff.

May: Containment for now, but I think we know that the Trump administration is working on a coherent, comprehensive strategy towards Iran. Doesn't have one yet, needs to have one, and it gets that.

Gigot: Thank you, Cliff May. Appreciate your coming.

When we come back, the Senate faces new hurdles in its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare after the Congressional Budget Office released its report on the House version of the bill. How to read those health care predictions, next.

Gigot: A much-anticipated report by the Congressional Budget Office was released this week outlining costs and coverage predictions for the House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. The CBO forecasting that the plan will cut taxes by $992 billion, cut spending by $1.1 trillion, and the deficit by $119 billion over 10 years. But also estimating that 23 million fewer people would be insured by 2026. That headline raising the stakes for GOP Senators working on their own version of the legislation that passed the House earlier this month.

We're back with Dan Henninger. "Wall Street Journal" Columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley; and editorial board member, Joe Rago.

So, Joe, how much stock should we put in these CBO estimates?

Joe Rago: What we should do is take these as an educated guess about what the future might hold but not treat them as some kind of holy writ carved in stone tablets. The CBO has a track record of overestimating the effects of government-directed policies, underestimating the effects of market-based policies. So it's one opinion, and take it with a grain of salt.

Gigot: But do other people think there'll be fewer people who will lose their insurance down the road here?

Rago: Certainly, there may be some kind of erosion in coverage, whether it's in absolute numbers working off an imperfect CBO baseline, maybe different types of insurance that the Congressional Budget Office doesn't considered adequate. But certainly, if you get a richer, more liquid market with more choices, more competition, you're likely to get a healthier market over time.

Gigot: Jason, the politics of this, what damage does it do?

Jason Riley: That's the problem. I think Joe's absolutely right, but the GOP still has a political problem with this number being out there and bandied about by Democrats. It's going to impact how the Senate tries to put together their version of this bill. You already see certain Senators coming out citing this number, saying we have to come in under it, whether it's Orrin Hatch in Utah, Susan Collins in Maine, Dean Heller in Nevada, who's very vulnerable next year.

Riley: They are worried about this number. So it does present a big political problem.

Henninger: Well, look, I mean, Donald Trump is getting more political sport from leaders in the Middle East than he is from Senate Republicans, which is kind of pathetic commentary on the Republican Party right now. But they cannot be intimidated by this CBO report. The CBO is described as this nonpartisan, disinterested body, just the facts, ma'am. But the idea of the health bill, in great part, is to put money back in the hands of the states, allow governors and legislators to decide how they going to --

Gigot: Particularly with Medicaid.

Henninger: Particularly with Medicaid. The CBO says they think one-third of the states will alter Obamacare based on it. How do they know that? That is a political judgment. That is not based on any facts or data. So this is in great part a political document.

Riley: I think, however, Paul, that the strategy of the Republicans should be to talk about the effects of Obamacare in the real world right now. There's been -- the -- Obamacare is failing, we see the evidence of it week after week after week, whether it's insurers pulling out of exchanges or making plans to pull out of exchanges, like Kansas City, Blue Cross Blue Shield did recently, talk about the real-world effects that the status quo is not an option. This cannot -- this is not sustainable. Instead however, though, and this is why I think for Democrats it was a good week, all the focus has been on that number. And Republicans have been playing defense all week. They need to go on the offense here.

Gigot: Joe, our friends on the left are blaming Trump and the Republicans for what's happening, for the decline in the Obamacare exchanges. That doesn't really add up.

Rago: No. I mean, look, this process started in 2015, 2016. You started to see the insurers start to withdraw, you started to see premiums really start to spike. So unless you have a time machine going back to before Trump was elected, what you're seeing is an acceleration of an already- existing trend.

Gigot: And that was something that a lot of critics predicted would happen.

Rago: Right. Except for the Congressional Budget Office.

Gigot: Except for -- which way overestimated by millions of people how many people would now be covered by Obamacare. What is it? I think they said 15, 16 million would be covered on the exchange?

Rago: Right. Under their original prediction, it was 23, 25 million for this year. We're actually looking at nine.

Gigot: Wow.

Rago: So just a huge overestimate.

On the politics, Republicans have to decide whether they want to defend an achievement that will fix some of these problems in the market or apologize for a failure. I think that's a pretty clear political decision.

Gigot: And that achievement would be actually passing a bill and then saying, look, here's what we did to fix this problem, and then defend it going into the election rather than saying, oh, well, we failed, let's all go home, sorry.

Rago: Right. We had this great opportunity and we wasted it on in- fighting and Congressional Budget Office scores.

Gigot: All right. Thanks to you all.

Still ahead, the White House unveils its 2018 budget, but critics say its economic forecast is far too optimistic. So is 3 percent growth really within reach?

OMB Director Mick Mulvaney : The foundation for the plan is 3 percent growth. In fact, that is Trumponomics. People ask me you're the budget director, what do you think about Trumponomics. Trumponomics is whatever can get us to 3 percent growth.

Gigot: White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney this week unveiling the Trump administration's budget for 2018. The $4.1 trillion plan seeks to eliminate the deficit in 10 years while avoiding cuts to Medicare and Social Security. All this based on the premise that the U.S. economy will reach 3 percent growth by 2021. So is that a realistic goal?

Let's ask economist, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. He's the president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

Welcome, Doug. Good to see you.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: Thanks for having me.

Gigot: So let's deal first with the 3 percent growth issue. Jason Furman, former White House economist under President Obama, wrote for us this week that you just can't really get there for any extended period anymore because population growth is too slow, and there are too many structural barriers. What do you think of that?

Holtz-Eakin: I don't agree with that. I mean, a lot of the structural barriers were erected by Jason Furman and the president he served, Barack Obama. So if you got serious about tax reform, if you got serious about regulatory reform, if you had a sensible, targeted national infrastructure program that enhanced national connectivity with economic performance, and if you took off the table the potential that the U.S. itself would have a sovereign debt crisis by getting the budget back to balance as they promise, you could get the 3 percent growth. That's certainly within the reasonable bounds. 4 or 5? No. But 3 is a sensible number.

Gigot: Well, but we had 4 percent growth over an extended period of years in the Reagan years in the 1980s and the late 1990s. Why can't that happen again? Is that just because the population growth isn't going to be as great?

Holtz-Eakin: Right. It's the population. I mean, the building blocks of growth are simple. You've got workers and productivity. And the growth in workers is slower now because of the demographics. And this is all about getting productivity growth back to where it should be. It's declined precipitously. And to do that, you need some ability to start businesses. We've seen business start-ups decline recently.

Gigot: Right.

Holtz-Eakin: You need capital investment in new technologies. There are lots of pieces that we know go into better productivity growth, and we haven't done those for a number of years.

Gigot: Well, and if you look at Trumponomics, which Mulvaney mentioned, I mean, deregulation, that reduces the barriers to capital investment and business confidence. Then you have tax reform, if it's done right -- and that's a big if -

Holtz-Eakin: A big if.

Gigot: But if it's done right, you're going to reduce the taxation on corporate income and small business income, and then you -- that's going to help investment. And those things both would drive greater business and worker productivity.

Holtz-Eakin: Sure. I mean, if you took, for example, the House-proposed tax reform, that's a plan that taken as a whole would incentivize firms to invest, innovate and grow in America as opposed to elsewhere. You'd get a one-time pop from a lot of money coming back to the U.S., you'd get sustained better investment, better allocation of capitol. You let markets do it, not the tax code. All that can give you a half a percentage point, if you do that.

Now, as you said, it's a big if. But remember, the president's budget is what will happen if the president gets everything he wants the way he wants it. So every president's budget is at some level an elaborate fantasy, but it tells you what the outer bounds are on the policy. That's what they're trying to stake out policy.

Gigot: All right, let's talk about the budget, some of the specifics in it. What's your biggest disappointment in the budget? I'll tell you mine. It's that there's no touching Medicare or Social Security, which takes a huge chunk off the table for any kind of fixes.

Holtz-Eakin: You've got it exactly right. That has to happen. We have Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, those programs are driving the ever-rising spending that fuels the red ink. If you take those two off the table, you can't really make sensible adjustments to the rest of the budget that add up. And you see that in the fact that they don't really have the out-year defense money that they need --

Gigot: Right.

Holtz-Eakin: -- made room for it, and they don't have a sensible strategy on cutting non-defense discretionary program. There's some massive cuts in places like National Institutes of Health, but they need that in the budget. That's the problem.

Gigot: So what do you like about the budget? Is there anything you really think is useful that's in there that's much needed?

Holtz-Eakin: There is a Medicaid reform. We're going to have to reform all of our entitlement programs. And critics don't like this one, but they are missing the point. There has to be one. So if you don't like this one, propose another one that you like better, but don't take Medicaid reform off the table. They're doing that, they're aiming for better growth, I think those are two big pluses in this budget.

Gigot: And the Medicaid budget, the big reform is sending the program back to the states in the sense that you take more responsibility for it, and if you have more stake in the game, the states, then reform it. And we've seen that in a lot of states. You know because you were watching that program.

Holtz-Eakin: Sure.

Gigot: A lot of states have done some very good things, Democrat and Republican governors, that get that program on a better footing and don't hurt the poor.

Holtz-Eakin: Yeah. I mean, there's no substitute for putting something on a budget. Once something's on a budget, and this puts it -- gives it to the states and says, here's the money, they have every incentive to use that money more wisely. It's a way better than an open-ended draw on the Treasury. And when we've done it in the past and given the states the flexibility, and look at Indiana and Wisconsin, they have managed to cover those populations, get better health care, and not spend as much money. That's the key.

Gigot: All right. General economic question here at the end. Why is the stock market doing so well here if there's so much uncertainty still in Washington about the Trump policies?

Holtz-Eakin: I think the number one thing is the fact that the regulatory freezes really worked. Obama was cruising along at $3.2 billion a week in new regulatory costs, and now it's zero.

Gigot: Wow.

Holtz-Eakin: People notice that. If you're running a business, the beatings have stopped and people are happy.

Gigot: You think that, and if you got tax reform, it'd be even better?

Holtz-Eakin: Yeah. I think the promise of tax reform is keeping people's hopes up. I sincerely hope the president and Congress deliver. It's something this country needs.

Gigot: Thank you very much, Doug.

Holtz-Eakin: Thank you.

Gigot: Still ahead, President Trump wraps up his first foreign trip and returns to the Washington maelstrom. A look at where the Russia probe heads next, when we come back.

Gigot: President Trump returns to Washington this weekend, and the ongoing controversy over Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Even in his absence, the drip, drip of stories continued with former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, taking the Fifth on Monday and refusing to comply with a Senate committee's subpoena for documents. In his testimony Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats refused to comment on reports that President Trump asked him to publicly deny allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia. And the president himself has reportedly retained the services of New York attorney, Mark Kasowitz, to help him navigate the probe.

We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.

One other detail, Mary, I want to ask you about. The report is Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, White House aide, is now a person of interest as the investigators want to ask him about meetings he had with Russian officials. What do you make of that?

Kissel: OK. That's interesting, but it's just part of this big what I think is becoming a blur to the American people of, you know, illusions and insinuations. Paul, the only thing that we know for sure that was a criminal act was the leak of classified information to the media. We know that for sure. Then let the special counsel go and figure out the facts of what's happened with other people.

Personally, I find far more interesting a "Washington Post" story that came out this week that said that James Comey may have acted, gone to the public with his findings about the Clinton e-mail investigation based on a Russian document that might have been planted by Russian intelligence sources. Now, why was --

Gigot: This was last summer.

Kissel: Yep. And why was this document interesting? Because it claimed that somehow Loretta Lynch had talked to the Clinton campaign and said, don't worry about that e-mail server, we're not going to investigate that. And then as "The Washington Post" reported, Comey may have acted on that information. If that's true, that means the Russians duped the FBI and DOJ, maybe not the Trump campaign.

Gigot: Which is entirely possible, that that happened, although we haven't seen that document.

Kissel: No, we haven't.

Gigot: So we don't know what it is, Bill, we don't know -- you know, there's so much of this, it's all kind of murky.

McGurn: Right.

Gigot: And I want to ask you has this probe now gotten any sharper focus in your mind, any more clarity about what it is that we're actually learning?

McGurn: Well, that's a good question because I think the purpose is not to have clarity. It's not to --

Gigot: Well, whose purpose?

McGurn: Well, I think Democrats and the people that are pushing this, they don't want to reach a conclusion and find out what happened. I think what they would like is to create this constant stir around President Trump and hope something sticks and maybe there's an impeachment. Now, he doesn't help when he lobs a tweet or something in there or says something, you know, that he shouldn't say. I mean, I always thought he need an editor, not a lawyer --

Gigot: He needs both now.

McGurn: A lot of this this is -- you know, I worked in the White House when there was an investigation into Scooter Libby and Karl Rove, and it really is designed to handicap you and freeze you up and change the debate from what you want to talk about to Russia. And we've had DNI, FBI, CIA and no, no conclusion.

Gigot: On Bill's point that Trump sometimes is his own worst enemy in this thing, the story about Trump having asked Dan Coats and I think General Rogers, is it, the head of the NSA, please go out publicly and vouch for the fact that there was no collusion. You can't do that when you are president, ask those advisers to do that. And his general counsel, Don McGahn, should have been in the room telling him, you can't do that or -- and been in the room when he asked them.

Henninger: Yeah.

Gigot: And this is the problem with this president, because there's no self-discipline there to try to say, look, I want to try to contain this probe and this damage. Instead, it's I'm innocent, and he blurts things out that only create another week of stories.

Henninger: Right. Yeah, normally, a president would be sitting with his advisers in the Oval Office and say, why can't we get directors of National Intelligence to say that there's no collusion. That would be vetted, and there'd be a reason why you can't do it.

This brings up the subject of the fact that Mr. Trump has now hired an outside attorney to handle these investigations who is his personal lawyer. He's a New York corporate lawyer, who's handled New York corporate cases. He is not a lawyer who specializes in these kinds of investigations you have in Washington. I can understand Mr. Trump wanting a lawyer who he personally trusts, but he -- Mr. Kasowitz has got to add some lawyers who are expert in document retrieval, investigation, subpoenas in Washington, or he's going to remain vulnerable.

Gigot: And he's known, Kasowitz, as a guy who really fights, which you might want. On the other hand, you want to have somebody that cooperates enough. You can't get anywhere in these things stonewalling. That just leads you down a terrible path, Bill.

McGurn: Yeah. I think, look, a lot of it for President Trump is just don't feed the beast. Don't throw something into the mix that -- you know, gasoline onto the fire that gives them more reason to scream and holler. And try to work with these guys to get conclusions. Let's look into these things and let's reach a conclusion about what happened and what didn't happen.

Kissel: Well, I think the other takeaway here was just the incredibly poor judgment that Trump showed in hiring General Michael Flynn. This is a guy who was paid by a Turkish group during the campaign. He registered later as a foreign agent. We know that, somehow, he misled the vice president, and now we're learning that he maybe didn't disclose everything that he should have disclosed when he was getting his security clearance renewed. So Trump came out and defended him. I think, at this point, you start to distance yourself from a guy like that, but Trump just can't seem to do that.

Gigot: The question is, some people have suggested that maybe he, you know, Trump is worried that Flynn might be able to implicate Trump in something. I'm not saying he has any evidence. I'm just saying that's the scuttlebutt.

Henninger: Evidence is the right word. I don't disagree with Mary, but let's look at what has been going on in this investigation for months. Everything is based on hearsay and insinuation. A thing that any prosecutor would say to a detective, give me something I can take into court, and they have not done that to this point.

Gigot: All right. Thank you all very much.

When we come back, state legislatures struggling for years with just how much they can or should consider race when redrawing political districts, so did this week's Supreme Court decision clear that question up or create more confusion?

Gigot: The Supreme Court weighing in this week on a closely watched voting rights case. In a 5-3 decision, the justices ruled that the Republican- controlled legislature in North Carolina improperly used race in redrawing the lines for two congressional districts resulting in boundaries that disadvantaged black voters.

"Wall Street Journal" editorial board member, Collin Levy, joins us with more.

Collin, what's the big takeaway from this decision?

Collin Levy: I think the big takeaway, Paul, is that the Supreme Court has made things more complicated. You know, for years basically we've been telling state legislatures they have to use the 1965 Voting Rights Act when drawing districts. They have to take some race into account to make sure that minority voters are able to elect a candidate of their choice. And what the Supreme Court basically said this week was, OK, you do have to take the Voting Rights Act into account, but you actually can't use that as a defense because, if you put too many minority voters into a district, that's impermissible concentration and violates equal protection. So this has actually gotten more confusing, I think, for states, not less.

Gigot: Where do they draw the line between not enough and too much?

Levy: Right, exactly. That's sort of what people call the Goldilocks problem here. In this case, this was a matter of moving just a few percentage points of minority voters into some of these districts. And, you know, Republicans there, who control the state legislature, said they were doing this because they wanted to sort of increase Republican chances in surrounding districts. And, you know, what happens here, what's so difficult is that because about 90 percent of the African-American community votes Democrat, moving black voters often means moving Democrats. So it gets a little muddy.

Gigot: Well, and that's right. I mean, they have -- there's no question that Republicans have used redistricting to pack some districts with more black voters --

Riley: Which is legal.

Gigot: They're commanded to, in some --

Riley: As Collin was saying, because here race can be a proxy for your political views, because of the high percentages that blacks vote Republican -- for Democrats, they find themselves in uncharted waters here. The Supreme Court has given them no guidance. They use the same language when it comes to affirmative action in higher education. They tell schools race can be a factor but not the determinant factor. Now you go figure it out.

And it's -- but, you know, Clarence Thomas --

Gigot: That's what I wanted to can about.

Riley: Yeah.

Gigot: So Clarence Thomas was the fifth vote here.

Riley: Right. Right.

Gigot: Now, you'd say Clarence Thomas -- I've looked at his jurisprudence for years -- he abhors the use of race as a -- in redistricting and anything else. He thinks the Constitution is essentially race-neutral.

Riley: Right. And that's why he voted --

Gigot: Why did he vote for the liberals --

Riley: Because, again, it's not whether race is a factor or the factor, he says, once you're talking about using race here, he thinks that's just an outdated notion, and that should not be the interpretation. And he's right. The thinking behind this gerrymandering is that we need to segregate voters by race in order for black elected, black figures to be elected. This is nonsense in this world we live in. Under Obama, lots of whites voted for Obama, and he wasn't the first black candidate to receive a lot of white votes. So I think this is just an outdated interpretation of the Voting Rights Act.

Gigot: But, Collin, is he, is Clarence Thomas with that vote for different reasons empowering the liberal interpretation of the Voting Rights Act?

Levy: Right. I think that's very interesting because I think what's happening here is the court has now acknowledged that there needs to be strict scrutiny on any use of race. And that's something that, you know, the whole court may consider again if there's another case that ever challenges section two of the Voting Rights Act.

Now, Paul, one of the other interesting things here though is how much this is probably going to increase litigation, you know, on these Voting Rights Act cases.

Gigot: Right.

Levy: As Samuel Alito said in his opinion, the danger here is that you actually have a situation where you're taking federal courts and empowering them as political weapons, you know, in these sort of local and state political battles, you know, where the states try to get through the courts what they're unable to get through the political process.

Gigot: Yeah. Race again will become more of a partisan weapon --

Henninger: Exactly, and that's what's going on here. Political gerrymanders are legal, racial gerrymanders are illegal. And the Democrats have discovered when they can file lawsuits, generally they win. It's a complete act of hypocrisy on their part.

Gigot: Racial gerrymanders are sometimes illegal. Sometimes, Jason, they're legal.

Riley: Well, and we look to the courts for some clarity on this. Again, they continue to punt as they've done again in this case.

Gigot: And as Samuel Alito, in his dissent, pointed this out, too.

Thank you all very much.

We have to take one more break. When we come back, "Hits Misses" of the week.

Gigot: Time now for our "Hits Misses" of the week.

Joe, start us off.

Rago: Paul, I think we've all had the impulse to strangle a journalist from time to time, but somehow we manage to resolve our differences civilly. So this is a miss to Greg Gianforte, the Montana Republican who body slammed a reporter for "The Guardian" ahead of a special congressional election on Thursday. He went on to win, believe it or not, but only by about five or six points in a state with an 11-point Republican advantage. This could be an ominous sign for the Republican majority ahead of the 2018 midterms and certainly an ominous sign for decent behavior in Congress.

Gigot: All right.

Collin?

Levy: Paul, we've become sort of accustomed in recent years to mobs on college campuses shutting down conservative speakers the way that Middlebury College did with conservative author, Charles Murray, this spring. But some legislatures have now had enough and they are starting to look at laws that will make sure that college campuses have free speech all over them, not just in designated free-speech zones. Places like Wisconsin and Tennessee are doing it. And some of them are better than others, but I think, you know, it's a sign that these states have finally had enough and it's a step in the right direction. So good for that.

Gigot: All right.

Jason?

Riley: Paul, it's a hit for Roger Moore who has died at the age of 89. He was not my favorite James Bond, but he did play the character in one of my favorite Bond movies, "For Your Eyes Only." I also thought he wore the celebrity well. He didn't complain about being typecast or throngs of fans bothering him wherever he went. He seemed to appreciate that there are worse things in life than being rich and famous. In that, he was sort of like the anti-George Clooney.

Gigot: All right.

Bill?

McGurn: Paul, I have both a miss and a hit on the same event, the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York coming up. The board of the parade announced that they were designating Oscar Lopez Rivera as a national hero, freedom hero. And that's backed by the speaker of the city council. It's provoked backlash. These people get a hit, the Yankees, the NYPD, Hispanic Society, for pulling out of the parade. Look, the truth is this guy is no different from the people who plotted Manchester, no moral difference, and there'd be no controversy if President Obama hadn't commuted his sentence.

Gigot: All right. Thank you all.

That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.

World News: U.S. Says it Has Shifted Strategy in Fight Against  ISIS 

By Tamer El-Ghobashy in Erbil, Iraq and Ghassan Adnan in Baghdad

The U.S. has switched to "annihilation tactics" against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, surrounding fighters instead of moving them from one spot to another, the defense secretary said Sunday.

"Our strategy right now is to accelerate the campaign against ISIS. It is a threat to all civilized nations. And the bottom line is we are going to move in an accelerated and reinforced manner, throw them on their back foot," Jim Mattis said on CBS News's "Face the Nation."

Iraqi forces have launched an offensive to reclaim the last districts of Mosul still under Islamic State control, considered the most difficult stage of this battle against the militants now in its eighth month.

Army, police and elite counterterrorism units began the assault on the edges of western Mosul's Old City before dawn on Saturday, backed by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes and artillery. Explosions from the strikes were heard starting from about 3 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.

"Our main mission is to liberate people before land," Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool, a spokesman for Iraq's military, said on Saturday.

Mosul was the largest city Islamic State controlled in Iraq and the Old City is home to the ancient Grand Nouri Mosque. The mosque was where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his only publicly recorded appearance, announcing the creation of a caliphate, or religious empire, in July 2014.

With the entire city encircled by Iraqi forces, U.S. and Iraqi commanders are expecting militants to put up fierce resistance in the last remaining patch of the city they occupy.

"Our intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to North Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa," Mr. Mattis said Sunday. "We're not going to allow them to do so. We're going to stop them there."

Iraq's military said recently that Islamic State controls less than 10% of western Mosul and has fortified it with booby traps in buildings and explosives along the Old City's narrow roads.

Iraqi troops will have to conduct the final battles on foot, foregoing armored vehicles that are too large for the streets and alleys in the area, which is still packed with some 200,000 civilians.

The United Nations is also bracing for the fight, which it expects will send most of those 200,000 people still living in the Old City fleeing for already overcrowded camps. On Friday, the U.N. said those remaining behind Islamic State lines lack clean water, medicine and food, and have been herded by the militants into explosive-laden houses to be used as human shields.

Islamic State snipers have deliberately targeted children, said Stephen O'Brien, the top U.N. humanitarian affairs official. Islamic State's use of human shields and the pace of U.S. airstrikes have had devastating consequences in the fight for western Mosul.

On Thursday, the Pentagon said a U.S. military investigation concluded that 101 civilians had been killed by a March 17 U.S. airstrike on a house that triggered secondary blasts of explosives placed by militants. The collapse of the building, where the civilians were sheltering, also left 36 people still missing.

World News: Egypt's Christians Targeted Again

Islamic State claimed it carried out the attack on a bus full of Coptic Christian pilgrims in central Egypt, which Egyptian officials said killed 29 people.

Islamic State's official news agency Amaq reported Saturday a team of Islamic State gunmen targeted the bus in Minya province on Friday because of its Coptic occupants.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi responded with airstrikes on what the military said were militant training camps in the eastern Libyan city of Derna. Mr. Sisi said the gunmen had trained and planned the attack in the camps in Libya, which borders Egypt. He provided no evidence to back up the claim, and Islamic State hasn't had a presence in Derna since late 2015.

The rare cross-border strikes by Egypt's military underscored the severity of the crisis Mr. Sisi's government is facing. There has been a rise in Islamic State attacks on Egypt's Christian minority since December.

The airstrikes also raised questions about Egypt's counterterrorism strategy. Islamic State had briefly controlled Derna in 2015 before it was expelled by a rival Islamist coalition with links to al Qaeda later that year. Islamic State then steadily lost most of its territory in Libya, culminating with its defeat in the coastal city of Sirte in December.

Egypt last struck Derna in February 2015 after the militants released a video showing the beheading of a group of Coptic Christian Egyptian laborers on a beach in Libya.

Friday's attack was carried out by gunmen in sport-utility vehicles who ambushed the bus carrying pilgrims to the St. Samuel monastery in Minya, about 190 miles south of Cairo.

It was part of a wave of violence against Egyptian Christians, who make up about 10% of the population. They had mostly supported Mr. Sisi's rise to power as the head of the military, which orchestrated a coup that ousted the country's first freely elected president, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013.

Mr. Sisi has struggled to contain the insurgency by Islamic State's Egyptian affiliate, which had been mostly confined to the remote northern region of the Sinai Peninsula. This has dented his credibility as the self-proclaimed stalwart against terrorism in the Middle East.

Mr. Sisi imposed a three-month national state of emergency in April after Palm Sunday suicide bombings by Islamic State's Egypt affiliate, Sinai Province, which killed at least 45 worshipers at churches in Alexandria and Tanta.

In December, an ISIS bombing at Cairo's Coptic cathedral killed 25 people, the largest attack on a Christian house of worship in Egypt since 2011.

Mokhtar Awad, an analyst at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said that with travel to Syria and Iraq becoming increasingly difficult, local militants have adopted the brutal tactics of Islamic State in those countries -- particularly the targeting of religious and ethnic minorities.

Gunmen in Egypt Attack Bus Carrying Coptic Christians, Prompting Airstrikes on Libya; After gunmen kill dozens of pilgrims, leader blamed Islamic State and other terrorists for sowing discord

Corrections & Amplifications

Egypt President Abdul Fattah Al Sisi blamed unidentified terrorists for the attack Friday on a bus of Christian pilgrims. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Mr. Sisi blamed Islamic State. (May 26).

MINYA, Egypt—unmen killed at least 28 people on a bus carrying Christian pilgrims in Egypt on Friday, prompting Egypt's President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi to order retaliatory airstrikes in Libya as he faces an emerging national security crisis.

The airstrikes, Egypt's first in Libya since 2015, came as Mr. Sisi, in a televised speech, blamed Islamic State and other terrorists for sowing discord in Egypt with a wave of attacks.

Ten of the dead in Friday's bus attack were children, traveling with their parents to visit an ancient monastery in central Egypt; many suffered bullet wounds to the head and chest, said Bishop Makarios, the highest Coptic clergyman in Minya Province, where the attack occurred.

Mr. Sisi, a former army chief who took power in a 2013 military coup and later won election with a vow to stamp out terrorism in his country, has cast himself as a regional leader in the fight against extremism.

As Islamic State's territory shrinks in Iraq and Syria, Egypt has seen more frequent and widespread attacks claimed by the group, particularly targeting the Christian minority. Coptic churches haven't been the only targets: Hundreds of families have fled their homes in the restive Sinai Peninsula after Islamic State extremists killed seven Coptic men and vowed to target others.

Egypt's military said Friday's airstrikes were conducted after they determined that the bus attack had originated with militants trained in Libya. Officials blamed unspecified "terrorist elements," and as of late Friday no group had claimed responsibility.

Egypt last struck Derna in February 2015 after Islamic State militants released a video showing the execution and beheading of a group of Coptic Egyptian laborers on a beach in Libya. At the time, Islamic State had taken control of Derna, but the group has since been driven out.

The mass shooting on Friday occurred as the bus, coming from the city of Beni Suef, stopped briefly on its way to the St. Samuel monastery, about 190 miles south of the capital Cairo. The attack also injured 24 people, according to the Interior Ministry.

Mr. Sisi in his speech called on all nations to join the fight against terrorism, and said he expected greater support from the administration of President Donald Trump.

Mr. Trump affirmed U.S. support for Egypt in a White House statement on Friday. "America stands with President Al Sisi and all the Egyptian people today, and always, as we fight to defeat this common enemy," he said.

Near the site of Friday's attack, as families of some of the victims prepared to bury their dead in a village in Minya province, bursts of anger punctuated the grief.

"I am Christian and I'm not scared!" scores of men chanted as they marched ahead of ambulances carrying the bodies of eight members of the Farouk family.

The funeral procession ended at the St. Marcus Church, where prayers were held for the family ahead of their burial.

Ayman Ezzat, a rickshaw driver, blamed the massacre on Mr. Sisi, saying the president hadn't done enough to protect Copts in Egypt, a view widely shared by Christians since a December church bombing in Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral that killed 25 people.

"Our lives have turned into hell," he said. "I'm a Copt and I curse myself everyday for bringing [Mr. Sisi] to power. He failed us. He sold us."

Bishop Makarios said while security forces can't be expected to protect all pilgrims to Coptic holy sites, Egypt's extensive intelligence gathering apparatus must do more to intercept attacks before they happen.

Mr. Sisi imposed a three-month national state of emergency last month after Palm Sunday suicide bombings by Islamic State's Egyptian affiliate, Sinai Province, killed at least 45 worshipers at Coptic churches in Alexandria and Tanta.

Attacks on Egypt's Christians have become more frequent and have spread from the Sinai Peninsula to the heart of Egypt's better-secured mainland—n indication, said Michael Hanna, an Egypt analyst at the New York-based Century Foundation, that Mr. Sisi's security forces don't have the capacity to contain insurgents.

"That such sophisticated attacks are increasing is suggestive of resilience, coordination, and state failure," said Mr. Hanna.

Mr. Sisi gained early support from the Coptic church on the belief that Christians would be safer under the former army general. Many Christians were fearful of persecution under then-President Mohammed Morsi, who was a senior official of the Muslim Brotherhood and the nation's first democratically elected president.

Early in his presidency, which began in 2014, Mr. Sisi spoke of a need to reform global Muslim communities to stamp out the spread of extremist ideology. Those statements won him plaudits and support from some Western leaders.

He also cracked down on his opponents, many of whom were political Islamists, prompting some Egyptians and international human-rights groups to accuse him of inflaming radicalism, rather than eradicating it.

Coptic Church leaders have since become impatient, saying Mr. Sisi has failed to secure their homes and houses of worship—nd has done little to address traditional issues of discrimination from the country's Muslim majority.

"It's too complex and too costly for him so he gave up on it," said Coptic activist Mina Magdy. Mr. Magdy said the state of emergency imposed last month wasn't followed with any meaningful security measures.

Critics of Mr. Sisi say that Egyptian authorities have chiefly used the state of emergency to detain his critics, including potential challengers for his office in 2018 elections, and to block independent news websites.

Spokesmen for the foreign ministry and president's office didn't respond to requests for comment on accusations that the government hasn't made protecting Christians a priority and that the state of emergency has been used to silence critics.

Sinai Province, the ISIS affiliate, has carried out hundreds of attacks on police and military personnel since 2014, mostly in the northern Sinai. It also claimed responsibility for the 2015 attack on a Russian airliner en route from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik that killed all 224 crew and passengers aboard.

In December, the group expanded its campaign to sow divisions in the country, vowing to step up attacks on Coptic Christians, who make up some 10% of the country's 92 million people and constitute the largest community of Christians in the Middle East. That threat came in a video in which it celebrated the December suicide bombing.

In late April, Pope Francis visited Cairo, invited by Mr. Sisi in part as a show of support for the beleaguered community. There, the pope spoke before thousands, delivering a forceful condemnation of religiously motivated violence while calling for greater religious freedoms.

Mr. Sisi has won strong support from Mr. Trump, and the two leaders have met repeatedly since the U.S. president took office in January, discussing Egypt's role in improving regional security.

Mr. Trump has said he admired Mr. Sisi's strong hand against terrorism. On Friday, in a statement issued by the White House, he condemned the "merciless slaughter" of Christians in Egypt.

Minya Province, the pilgrims' destination on Friday, has the largest population of Coptic Christians in the country, and has been the site of frequent attacks by Muslims with sectarian agendas for more than a decade.

Violence escalated there sharply in 2013, following the coup against Mr. Morsi. After Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic leader, appeared alongside Mr. Sisi during the public announcement of the coup, some of Mr. Morsi's followers in Minya burned churches and attacked Christians, assuming they had supported it.

Informal reconciliation councils, established to damp tensions, have routinely ruled in favor of Muslim parties. That has led to Coptic accusations of government discrimination.

Philippines Says Foreign Fighters Have Joined Militant Group; Official characterizes conflict as an invasion, bolstering supporters of Duterte, martial law

MANILA—oreign fighters have joined an Islamic State-linked militant group occupying a southern Philippine city and are seeking to turn the island of Mindanao into a caliphate, a government official said, calling the development an invasion.

While foreign fighters have long been suspected of joining militant groups in lawless parts of Mindanao, the government's announcement escalates a fragile situation in a region where troops are engaged in heavy fighting with militants.

Philippine Solicitor General Jose Calida's characterization of the conflict bolsters supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte, who on Tuesday declared martial law for the entirety of Mindanao—ome to 22 million people—ut his comments will likely to be met with skepticism by opponents who say the government's decision was draconian.

"What's happening in Mindanao is no longer a rebellion of Filipino citizens. It has transmogrified into invasion by foreign terrorists who heeded the clarion call of ISIS to go to the Philippines if they feel difficulty in going to Iraq or Syria," said Mr. Calida. He was referring to the terrorist group by its acronym, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and said that the foreigners involved were from Malaysia and Indonesia.

It is the president's constitutional duty to "unsheathe the republic's sword of martial law to crush the rebellion," he said, calling on Filipinos to trust in the wisdom of Mr. Duterte.

Government troops have pounded the city of Marawi on Mindanao with airstrikes and mortar fire as the battle drags on for a fourth day. At least 44 people have died in the fighting, including 31 militants.

Troops are trying try to free hostages and rid the town of dozens of fighters from the Maute group, a heavily armed militancy that occupied the city on Tuesday and burned several buildings, thwarting an attempt by authorities to arrest a notorious faction leader.

Mr. Duterte said he needed martial law to restore order to Mindanao and prevent Maute fighters from escaping. Its imposition, however, has worried rights activists and opponents of the president, who say martial law unnecessarily undermines liberties and threatens to derail fragile peace negotiations with several other groups in the restive area.

For decades, the Philippines government has fought several insurgencies in the jungles and poorer regions of Mindanao, where disparate groups and complex alliances are divided along racial, ideological and religious lines. Many of these groups, though separate from the Islamic State-linked Maute group, are heavily armed and have turned to violence and terrorism in the past to achieve their goals.

In recent years the government has sought peace with some of the older and larger groups, such as the communist New People's Army and the Muslim separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front, an effort that has been mostly continued by Mr. Duterte's administration.

But that process has been threatened, some critics say, by the imposition of martial law.

Renato Reyes, an activist who represents an alliance of left-wing and communist groups in the Philippines, said martial law is a concern because "the martial powers of the president are quite broad" and the human-rights record of law enforcement is very poor.

The communist National Democratic Front of the Philippines publicly denounced martial law on Wednesday and called upon the New People's Army to accelerate recruitment.

The Moro Islamic Liberation Front didn't explicitly oppose martial law, but called on the government to protect the peace so no other groups use its nonimplementation to justify pursuit of violence.

In an attempt to allay concerns, armed forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said Friday martial law "does not target peace-inclined groups" and asked for trust and vigilance from the public.

While the Philippines military has played down the impact of martial law on other groups, Mr. Duterte said on Wednesday he would be "harsh" and compared his own declaration of martial law to that of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, whose regime used torture and murder to sustain his rule of more than two decades.

Mr. Duterte also threatened to expand his declaration to the entire country if he felt like it.

"For the longest time we have had very weak public institutions—ncluding security institutions—o that plays right into the heart of the question of safeguards and the question of effectiveness," said Edmund Tayao, a political analyst and expert in democracy and governance at the Local Government Development Foundation in the Philippines.

The Philippine constitution grants the president power to declare martial law for up to 60 days, thereby allowing warrantless arrests. The country's joint houses of Congress must approve the declaration, which they are expected to do on Monday. Any citizen of the Philippines has the right to challenge the declaration in the Supreme Court.

While there are many safeguards that protect against abuse of martial law, said Mr. Tayao, "there is really nothing that says we should not be vigilant."

U.S. Airstrike Killed

Civilians by Accident

A U.S. airstrike on a suspected Islamic State fighting position in Mosul in March unintentionally killed more than 100 civilians, most of whom died as a result of a secondary blast from munitions packed into a residential area by extremists, a military investigation released Thursday concluded.

The Defense Department said the March 17 airstrike targeted a pair of militant snipers, but triggered a follow-on explosion that collapsed part of a building, killed 101 civilians and left three dozen missing, according to results of the military investigation.

"The investigation determined that ISIS emplaced a large amount of explosive material in a structure containing a significant number of civilians and then attacked Iraqi forces from the structure," said a statement from the U.S.-led coalition taking part in the campaign to retake Mosul.

Trump Faces the Fury of a Scorned Ruling Class

A lobbyist friend who visited Capitol Hill recently came away horrified. "I now am ready to believe that the partisanship is so unhinged that it's a threat to the Republic," she writes in an email.

This Washington hysteria comes at a time of full employment, booming stocks, relative peace and technological marvels like an electronic robot named Alexa who fetches and plays for you songs of your choice. What's the fuss about?

We all know the answer: Donald Trump. The Washington body politic has been invaded by an alien presence and, true to the laws of nature, that body is feverishly trying to expel it. These particular laws of nature demand rejection of anything that threatens the livelihoods and prestige of the permanent governing class.

The "threat" that has Washington quaking is the first serious effort in a long time to curb federal regulatory power, wasteful spending, and a propensity to run up mountainous budget deficits and debt. That's presumably what the voters wanted when they elected Donald Trump. Democrats -- accurately regarded as the party of government -- seem to fear that Mr. Trump might actually, against all odds, pull it off.

The Washington Post, the New York Times and other apostles of the Democratic Party have apparently set out to prove that despite their shaky business models they can still ignite an anti-Trump bonfire. A recent headline in the Post. asserted that "Trump's scandals stoke fear for the 2018 midterms among Republicans nationwide."

What scandals would those be? There was of course the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Democrat Hillary Clinton went on TV to claim that Mr. Comey cost her the election. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey. Did Democrats praise the president? No, they want him impeached. Devious logic, but devious is a good descriptor of much of what goes on in this fight.

Mr. Comey retaliated by leaking a "big scoop" to the Times -- notes taken when Mr. Trump allegedly asked him to back off on the investigation of national security adviser Mike Flynn. But let's recall the circumstances of this "investigation." The Obama administration -- possibly the FBI -- tapped a phone conversation between Mr. Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Then Mr. Obama's minions used the raw data to "unmask" Mr. Flynn and get the retired general fired for not giving a full account of the discussion. Given that sorry record of political involvement, was Mr. Trump so wrong if he asked Mr. Comey to go easy?

Then there was the Post's "shocking" revelation that the president gave classified information to Russia's foreign minister. The president is commander in chief of the U.S. military and conducts foreign policy. The intelligence agencies work for him, and he is responsible for using what they provide to further U.S. interests. Is it so unlikely that a friendly tip to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about an ISIS tactic was calculated to earn trust? A more interesting question is who walked out of the room and illegally handed the Post this "scoop."

Russians aren't popular in the U.S., for many good reasons. That has its uses for Trump baiters. Democratic claims that Mr. Trump conspired with the Russians to swing the November election led the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor, former FBI chief Robert Mueller, to investigate. But is this claim even slightly plausible? So far all we have are anonymous officials who claim that intelligence agencies know of individuals with connections to the Russian government who supplied WikiLeaks with hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta's accounts. But these officials are still unwilling to go on the record.

The Washington community knows how to fight back when it feels threatened. Leakers are having a ball, even if it has taken a lot of journalistic imagination to turn the most notorious leaks into "scandals." Almost everyone in town has a stake in fending off the Trump threat: government workers and the businesses that serve them, public unions, lobbyists and their clients, owners of posh hotels and restaurants that cater to well-heeled visitors seeking government favors, journalists whose prestige derives from the power center they cover, academics who show politicians how to mismanage the economy, real-estate agents feeding on the boom -- to name a few. It's a good living, and few take kindly to a brash outsider who proclaims it is his mission to drain the swamp.

Mr. Trump is on the attack and Washington is fighting back. Is the Republic in danger? Another question is how much danger will it be in if Mr. Trump loses?

U.K. Terror Attack: Islamic State Adapts As It Loses Territory

With Islamic State rapidly losing territory in Syria and Iraq, the group is relying more on homegrown terrorists such as the Manchester attacker while also sending more of its fighters abroad to stir violence, Western and Middle Eastern officials warn.

The suicide bombing that killed 22 people Monday outside a concert venue in the British city came as counterterrorism officials said they have been picking up mounting anecdotal evidence that Islamic State is redeploying its resources.

Iraqi forces have expelled the radical fighters from most of Mosul -- their last stronghold in the country -- and the group has been steadily losing ground in neighboring Syria as well.

"As ISIS loses territory, members are returning" to Europe, said a counterterrorism official for one of Iraq's Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The official was in Austria on Tuesday briefing Western colleagues on the latest from the ground in northern Iraq. "There will be more attacks in Europe," the official predicted.

British Home Secretary Amber Rudd identified the suicide bomber as 22-year-old Salman Abedi and said he had traveled to the North African nation of Libya, where Islamic State has an active presence. Abedi's sister told The Wall Street Journal her brother was born and raised in England.

It wasn't yet clear whether Abedi, while abroad made contact with Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Manchester bombing.

The attack came as Islamic State is facing greater difficulties operating in Europe. Some fighters, both Europeans and Syrians, have slipped away after battle and are tapping cash stashed abroad, recent defectors, counterterrorism officials and other experts interviewed by the Journal said.

"They are not disappearing. They are just going underground," a European security official said.

One counterterrorism consultant for the U.K. government said banks have detected surprising movements of British jihadists returning. Though they are using fake passports, cash withdrawals show they travel to Malaysia, Italy and Dublin before flying back to Britain, the consultant said.

Some Syrian Islamic State operatives have been sent to Germany to blend in with the large refugee population, a European counterterrorism official said. To move money in Europe, they have been using prepaid travel cards, the official said.

The patterns suggest Islamic State is directing them to use diverging paths so they won't be detected when they return to Europe, the consultant said.

Wonder Land: From 9/11 to Manchester

By Daniel Henninger 
871 words
26 May 2017
The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)

Now we have Manchester and its 22 dead, many of them children. Somehow, we always end up back at 9/11, leaving flowers and candles again.

A political constant since 9/11 is that terrorism inevitably changes U.S. presidencies. I think the events this week -- the president's overseas trip and then Manchester -- may have a similar effect on Donald Trump.

On Inauguration Day in January 2001, George W. Bush's mind no doubt was filled with plans for his first term. Months later, his was a war presidency and would remain so.

Several things sit in my memory from the politics of that period. One is President Bush's face as he addressed Congress on Sept. 20. He was a changed man. Also remembered is the solidarity of national purpose after the attack. The final memory is how quickly that unity dissipated into a standard partisan melee.

The Democratic point of attack became the Patriot Act's surveillance provisions, a legal and legislative battle that ran the length of the Bush presidency. By the end of his second term, George Bush had become an object of partisan caricature and antipathy equal to anything President Trump endures now.

During Barack Obama's presidency, four major terrorist attacks took place inside the U.S.: Fort Hood in 2009, the Boston Marathon in 2013, San Bernardino two years later and then Orlando in 2016. During these years, the locus of terror migrated from al Qaeda to Islamic State.

Volumes have been written about Barack Obama and terrorism, much of it about the president's struggles with vocabulary terms such as war, Islam, extreme and radical. The killing of Osama bin Laden evinced a rare, passing moment of national unity.

With the opposition to the Trump presidency programmed for driverless resistance, there will be no national unity in the war on terrorism. The Democrats have become the Trump-Is-Russia Party, and that may be as good a way as any for them to spend their waking hours.

But even Hillary Clinton couldn't duck the terrorism problem in the 2016 presidential campaign, and when Mr. Trump said he would "defeat ISIS," his lack of nuance no doubt won him votes.

Which brings us to Manchester this week and memories of 9/11.

Note the political response to the Manchester murders. Again, total solidarity, such as this from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: "These cowardly attacks will only strengthen our commitment to work together to defeat the perpetrators of such vile acts."

McMaster.

The policy entails the U.S. sale to Saudi Arabia over 10 years of $450 billion of military equipment -- tanks, ships, precision-guided bombs -- in return for Saudi leadership of an Arab-state coalition, which is their idea, to fight Islamic terrorists in the region and thwart Iran's territorial ambitions.

Wonder Land
From 9/11 to Manchester

Now we have Manchester and its 22 dead, many of them children. Somehow, we always end up back at 9/11, leaving flowers and candles again.

A political constant since 9/11 is that terrorism inevitably changes U.S. presidencies. I think the events this week -- the president's overseas trip and then Manchester -- may have a similar effect on Donald Trump.

On Inauguration Day in January 2001, George W. Bush's mind no doubt was filled with plans for his first term. Months later, his was a war presidency and would remain so.

Several things sit in my memory from the politics of that period. One is President Bush's face as he addressed Congress on Sept. 20. He was a changed man. Also remembered is the solidarity of national purpose after the attack. The final memory is how quickly that unity dissipated into a standard partisan melee.

The Democratic point of attack became the Patriot Act's surveillance provisions, a legal and legislative battle that ran the length of the Bush presidency. By the end of his second term, George Bush had become an object of partisan caricature and antipathy equal to anything President Trump endures now.

During Barack Obama's presidency, four major terrorist attacks took place inside the U.S.: Fort Hood in 2009, the Boston Marathon in 2013, San Bernardino two years later and then Orlando in 2016. During these years, the locus of terror migrated from al Qaeda to Islamic State.

Volumes have been written about Barack Obama and terrorism, much of it about the president's struggles with vocabulary terms such as war, Islam, extreme and radical. The killing of Osama bin Laden evinced a rare, passing moment of national unity.

With the opposition to the Trump presidency programmed for driverless resistance, there will be no national unity in the war on terrorism. The Democrats have become the Trump-Is-Russia Party, and that may be as good a way as any for them to spend their waking hours.

But even Hillary Clinton couldn't duck the terrorism problem in the 2016 presidential campaign, and when Mr. Trump said he would "defeat ISIS," his lack of nuance no doubt won him votes.

Which brings us to Manchester this week and memories of 9/11.

Note the political response to the Manchester murders. Again, total solidarity, such as this from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: "These cowardly attacks will only strengthen our commitment to work together to defeat the perpetrators of such vile acts."

Post-9/11, naturally one expects such commitments to erode like sand castles. But this time, by coincidence, alleged Manchester bomber Salman Abedi murdered concertgoers in the same week Donald Trump was using his first overseas trip to build a coalition to defeat Islamic State.

This was not a routine presidential foreign trip for self-pomp and circumstance.

Trump Faces the Fury of a Scorned Ruling Class; The 'threat' that has elites quaking is his serious attempt to curb federal power and cut spending.

A lobbyist friend who visited Capitol Hill recently came away horrified. "I now am ready to believe that the partisanship is so unhinged that it's a threat to the Republic," she writes in an email.

This Washington hysteria comes at a time of full employment, booming stocks, relative peace and technological marvels like an electronic robot named Alexa who fetches and plays for you songs of your choice. What's the fuss about?

We all know the answer: Donald Trump. The Washington body politic has been invaded by an alien presence and, true to the laws of nature, that body is feverishly trying to expel it. These particular laws of nature demand rejection of anything that threatens the livelihoods and prestige of the permanent governing class.

The "threat" that has Washington quaking is the first serious effort in a long time to curb federal regulatory power, wasteful spending, and a propensity to run up mountainous budget deficits and debt. That's presumably what the voters wanted when they elected Donald Trump. Democrats—ccurately regarded as the party of government—eem to fear that Mr. Trump might actually, against all odds, pull it off.

The Washington Post, the New York Times and other apostles of the Democratic Party have apparently set out to prove that despite their shaky business models they can still ignite an anti-Trump bonfire. A recent headline in the Post. asserted that "Trump's scandals stoke fear for the 2018 midterms among Republicans nationwide."

What scandals would those be? There was of course the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Democrat Hillary Clinton went on TV to claim that Mr. Comey cost her the election. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey. Did Democrats praise the president? No, they want him impeached. Devious logic, but devious is a good descriptor of much of what goes on in this fight.

Mr. Comey retaliated by leaking a "big scoop" to the Times—otes taken when Mr. Trump allegedly asked him to back off on the investigation of national security adviser Mike Flynn. But let's recall the circumstances of this "investigation." The Obama administration—ossibly the FBI—apped a phone conversation between Mr. Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Then Mr. Obama's minions used the raw data to "unmask" Mr. Flynn and get the retired general fired for not giving a full account of the discussion. Given that sorry record of political involvement, was Mr. Trump so wrong if he asked Mr. Comey to go easy?

Then there was the Post's "shocking" revelation that the president gave classified information to Russia's foreign minister. The president is commander in chief of the U.S. military and conducts foreign policy. The intelligence agencies work for him, and he is responsible for using what they provide to further U.S. interests. Is it so unlikely that a friendly tip to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about an ISIS tactic was calculated to earn trust? A more interesting question is who walked out of the room and illegally handed the Post this "scoop."

Russians aren't popular in the U.S., for many good reasons. That has its uses for Trump baiters. Democratic claims that Mr. Trump conspired with the Russians to swing the November election led the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor, former FBI chief Robert Mueller, to investigate. But is this claim even slightly plausible? So far all we have are anonymous officials who claim that intelligence agencies know of individuals with connections to the Russian government who supplied WikiLeaks with hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta's accounts. But these officials are still unwilling to go on the record.

The Washington community knows how to fight back when it feels threatened. Leakers are having a ball, even if it has taken a lot of journalistic imagination to turn the most notorious leaks into "scandals." Almost everyone in town has a stake in fending off the Trump threat: government workers and the businesses that serve them, public unions, lobbyists and their clients, owners of posh hotels and restaurants that cater to well-heeled visitors seeking government favors, journalists whose prestige derives from the power center they cover, academics who show politicians how to mismanage the economy, real-estate agents feeding on the boom—o name a few. It's a good living, and few take kindly to a brash outsider who proclaims it is his mission to drain the swamp.

Mr. Trump is on the attack and Washington is fighting back. Is the Republic in danger? Another question is how much danger will it be in if Mr. Trump loses?

Probe: U.S. Strike in Mosul Ignited  ISIS  Munitions, Killing Civilians; Islamic State's tactic of putting explosive material in a structure with civilians was behind the casualties, Pentagon says

WASHINGTON— U.S. airstrike on a suspected Islamic State fighting position in March unintentionally killed more than 100 civilians, most of whom died as a result of a secondary blast from munitions packed into a residential area by extremists, a military investigation released Thursday concluded.

The Pentagon said the March 17 airstrike targeted a pair of militant snipers, but triggered a follow-on explosion that collapsed part of a building, killed 101 civilians and left three dozen missing, according to results of the military investigation.

Local Iraqi officials and residents lodged immediate complaints about the strike, and the Pentagon began a formal investigation.

"The investigation determined that ISIS emplaced a large amount of explosive material in a structure containing a significant number of civilians and then attacked Iraqi forces from the structure," said a statement from the U.S.-led coalition taking part in the Mosul campaign.

Residents of Mosul have long complained of new Islamic State tactics of herding civilians into buildings then, using rooftops of those buildings as fighting positions against Iraqi security forces, inviting airstrikes that would lead to extensive civilian casualties.

Islamic State also has parked car bombs near such buildings in hopes any airstrikes would detonate them, creating a devastating blast certain to kill civilians that could be blamed on the U.S., residents of the city have said in interviews.

Pentagon officials have confirmed that Islamic State has made use of the tactic. Iraqi officials have said as many as 200 people might have been killed in the blast.

"Neither coalition nor Iraqi forces knew that civilians were sheltered within the structure," a U.S. statement said. "The coalition selected a single GBU-38 precision-guided munition as the most appropriate and proportionate means of engagement to neutralize the threat and to minimize collateral damage."

A GBU-38 is a precision-guided 500-pound bomb able to hit "pinpoint" targets.

The coalition didn't say what kind of explosive caused the major damage that led the building to collapse, but said residue from the blast included an explosive known as PETN as well as nitroglycerin, substances that are consistent with explosives commonly used by Islamic State but not contained in a GBU-38.

"This ISIS-emplaced explosive material conservatively contained more than four times the net explosive weight of the GBU-38," the investigation said.

Coalition investigators said the bomb was dropped in accordance with laws of armed conflict and U.S. rules of engagement.

"The Coalition takes every feasible measure to protect civilians from harm," said Maj. Gen. Joe Martin, the commander of the coalition's land forces. "The best way to protect civilians is to defeat ISIS."

U.K. Terror Attack: Suspect's Visits To Libya Reflect  ISIS 's Influence

Outside Iraq and Syria, the radicals of Islamic State administered territory in only one other country: Libya.

As British investigators search for links between Islamic State and the Manchester bombing, focus has turned to the North African country, where the militant group ruled one of the oil-rich nation's most important cities and used it to stage terrorist attacks and train foreign fighters.

Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old man thought by British authorities to have carried out the bombing for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, was a British citizen of Libyan descent. His journeys in and out of a country where the militant group once cast a large shadow are now a central focus of investigators, a Western security official said.

For more than a year, Islamic State controlled the port city of Sirte, imposing its signature brutal rule and exploiting the anarchy of the politically divided country to train and slip fighters into neighboring Tunisia, where they targeted European tourists.

Since a powerful western Libyan militia, aided by U.S. airstrikes, ousted it from Sirte in December, the group's foothold in the country has shrunk, but in a land where rival governments are vying for control, European and Arab officials remain concerned about the group's ability to mount attacks abroad.

Last year, the U.S. planned to kill an Islamic State leader from France who was using the messaging app Telegram to threaten his native country with bloodshed, a Western security official said. He also sent fellow Europeans to France, possibly to carry out attacks, the official said.

The militant leader, however, was hiding at the Sirte power station and any airstrike could have caused electricity blackouts across large parts of Libya, so no raid was launched, the official said. The French militant's current location is unknown.

In January, the U.S. bombed Islamic State training camps in Libya's desert interior, illustrating Washington's concern over the continued threat posed by the group but also underscoring how far it had been pushed from the country's more heavily populated Mediterranean coast.

U.K. Terror Attack: Losing Ground, Terrorists Adapt

With Islamic State rapidly losing territory in Syria and Iraq, the group is relying more on homegrown terrorists such as the Manchester attacker while also sending more of its fighters abroad to stir violence, Western and Middle Eastern officials warn.

The suicide bombing that killed 22 people Monday night outside a concert venue in the British city came as counterterrorism officials said they have been picking up mounting anecdotal evidence that Islamic State is redeploying its resources.

Iraqi forces have expelled the radical fighters from most of Mosul -- their last stronghold in the country -- and the group has been losing ground in neighboring Syria as well.

"As ISIS loses territory, members are returning" to Europe, said a counterterrorism official for one of Iraq's Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The official was in Austria on Tuesday briefing Western colleagues on the latest from the ground in northern Iraq. "There will be more attacks in Europe," the official predicted.

The attack came as Islamic State is facing greater difficulties operating in Europe. Some fighters, both Europeans and Syrians, have slipped away after battle and are tapping cash stashed abroad, according to recent defectors, counterterrorism officials and other experts interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

"They are not disappearing. They are just going underground," a European security official said.

One counterterrorism consultant for the U.K. government said banks have detected surprising movements of British jihadists returning to their home country. Though they are using fake passports, cash withdrawals show they travel to Malaysia, Italy and Dublin before flying back to Britain, the consultant said.

Some Syrian Islamic State operatives have been sent to Germany to blend in with the large refugee population, a European counterterrorism official said. To move money in Europe, they have been using prepaid travel cards, the official said.

The patterns suggest Islamic State is directing them to use diverging paths so they won't be detected when they return to Europe, the consultant said. Islamic State members from Western countries are often caught when they return through Turkey.

A second European counterterrorism official said Islamic State is testing whether it can settle its members in countries where the group has no presence. Islamic State fighters have told he Journal that because the group's networks have unraveled in Europe under heightened scrutiny there, it will increase attacks around the Mideast outside the areas it controls.

Arrivals have been noticed in Sudan, Morocco and Senegal in recent months, the official said. The group is also sending Middle Eastern members because they realize most Europeans are now known to Western intelligence, according to Western counterterrorism officials, Islamic State defectors and Syrian activists.

In Germany, authorities are increasingly concerned about potential terrorists hiding among the 1.2 million asylum seekers who have entered the country in the past two years.

NATO's Vital Role in the War on Terror

By Jens Stoltenberg

At first glance, it's simply a fragment of twisted metal outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's new headquarters in Brussels. But this 6-foot-long section of steel girder was recovered from the ruins of the World Trade Center. At its official unveiling Thursday, we will hail the artifact as a symbol of solidarity: Europe and North America standing together.

Two years ago I spoke at the 9/11 Memorial in New York. Being there, at the site of the attacks, reinforced my firm belief that however much terrorists try to divide us, they will only succeed in uniting us.

This is exactly what happened after 9/11. For the first time ever, NATO allies invoked our collective defense clause, Article 5. We recognized those shocking assaults on the U.S. as an attack against us all.

In the days that followed, NATO planes patrolled American skies. Within weeks, troops from NATO allies deployed to Afghanistan to ensure that country would never again be a haven for international terrorists. The biggest combat operation in NATO history was launched in direct response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Since then, hundreds of thousands of Europeans, Canadians and troops from partner countries have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their American comrades in Afghanistan. More than 1,000 have paid the ultimate price. Many more have suffered life-changing injuries.

At this moment, approximately 13,000 troops from 39 NATO and partner countries are training Afghan security forces to stabilize the country. And at a meeting of NATO leaders in Brussels on Thursday we will discuss how we can step up our fight against terrorism.

We never said it would be easy. On my visits to Afghanistan, I have witnessed the challenges, as well as the progress made. I was particularly impressed by my meeting with young Afghan women training to become pilots. I heard them express pride in what they are doing and appreciation for NATO's support.

While NATO's contribution to the fight against terrorism effectively began in Afghanistan, it now extends far wider.

NATO surveillance planes are supporting the coalition to defeat the so-called Islamic State. Iraqi troops trained by NATO to defuse improvised explosive devices are putting their skills to use in the battle for Mosul. We have taught soldiers counterterrorism and counterinsurgency tactics in countries like Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Morocco. And our highly skilled troops are helping Tunisia develop its own special forces.

Earlier this year, we opened a regional center in Kuwait to enhance cooperation with our Gulf partners. We are also developing a new operational hub at our command in Naples, Italy, to improve our ability to anticipate and respond to crises in the region. At our headquarters in Brussels we have set up a new intelligence and security division to improve our understanding of the threats we face.

At the same time, we are strengthening ties with the European Union and United Nations. Both organizations' counterterrorism capabilities complement our own. And we are working hard throughout the alliance to make our societies more resilient to attack.

While I am very proud of what NATO is already doing in the fight against terrorism, I also believe NATO can do more. For instance, we have learned from our experiences in Afghanistan and elsewhere that training local forces is one of the best weapons we have in the fight against terrorism. It is far better, and more sustainable, to help our neighbors to stabilize their countries themselves. And if our neighbors are more stable, we are more secure. These efforts must be expanded.

There are other possibilities. Although NATO has assisted the coalition fighting ISIS, it does not have a formal role. Having one would allow NATO to support political discussions in the coalition. It would also improve coordination, for example, with training and capacity-building activities. It would not mean NATO involvement in combat operations.

We are also considering expanding our support to airspace surveillance for the coalition. An expanded training and capacity-building role for NATO's special forces and the creation of a dedicated counterterrorism intelligence cell are also under consideration.

Terrorism affects every NATO ally. It is a long-term threat to our values, freedom and way of life. And the alliance is ready to do more to counter this threat. The unique bond between Europe and North America has delivered unprecedented peace for almost seven decades, and NATO's role in the fight against terrorism is an important chapter in that story.

From 9/11 to Manchester

But even Hillary Clinton couldn't duck the terrorism problem in the 2016 presidential campaign, and when Mr. Trump said he would "defeat ISIS," his lack of nuance no doubt won him votes.

Which brings us to Manchester this week and memories of 9/11.

Note the political response to the Manchester murders. Again, total solidarity, such as this from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: "These cowardly attacks will only strengthen our commitment to work together to defeat the perpetrators of such vile acts."

Post-9/11, naturally one expects such commitments to erode like sand castles. But this time, by coincidence, alleged Manchester bomber Salman Abedi murdered concertgoers in the same week Donald Trump was using his first overseas trip to build a coalition to defeat Islamic State.

This was not a routine presidential foreign trip for self-pomp and circumstance. Mr. Trump went to Saudi Arabia to initiate an anti-ISIS policy designed and midwifed by three Trump appointees and Middle East specialists -- Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster.

The policy entails the U.S. sale over 10 years to Saudi Arabia of $450 billion of military equipment -- tanks, ships, precision-guided bombs -- in return for Saudi leadership of an Arab-state coalition, which is their idea, to fight Islamic terrorists in the region and thwart Iran's territorial ambitions.

A New York Times online summary of the speech Mr. Trump delivered Sunday in Riyadh called it "a speech about Islam." I thought it was about something larger than that.

For instance, the Times and Washington Post ran stories about how the Trump foreign policy has demoted human-rights issues. It has not. Implicit in the Trump-Tillerson formulation is that defining the abuse of human rights as oppression by governments, such as Saudi Arabia's, is too narrow. Now, any discourse over human rights must include the right not to have one's life ended by acts of organized terrorism.

Grasping at Trumpian straws is a fact of life, but I am going to hazard not much more than a thought, which is that the president who left for Saudi Arabia last Friday will not be the same president who returns here this weekend.

Delivering that big foreign-policy speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump looked like he was passing through a moment familiar to George W. Bush and other presidents in the post-World War II period -- coming to grips with the gravity of why his office matters to the world. Being president isn't enough. Something always has to penetrate the parochial bubble of U.S. politics for this transition to happen, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the Carter presidency.

Mr. Trump meets Thursday in Brussels with NATO allies who since 2015 have experienced Islamic State's mass murders in Paris, Nice, Berlin, Copenhagen, Brussels, Stockholm, London and now Manchester.

His basic message -- it's time to get serious -- is important and deserves support, both over there and in the White House.

Clashes Escalate in Southern Philippines

Security forces closing in on a senior leader of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group, who has pledged to create an Islamic caliphate in the troubled southern Philippines, clashed for a second day with militants who came to his rescue.

A combined police and military operation attempted on Tuesday to arrest the leader, Isnilon Hapilon, sparking the battle in the city of Marawi. The effort was unsuccessful and complicated by fighters from the Maute group, an organization aligned with Mr. Hapilon, who attacked the city, occupying buildings and waving a black Islamic State flag.

The fight took another twist Tuesday evening when a Roman Catholic bishop in Marawi said he received a call from the militants claiming to have taken several of his congregation and a priest hostage, according to the official news website of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. The militants threatened to kill the hostages if their demands for a cease-fire and safe passage out of Marawi weren't met, the Conference news service reported. There was no immediate confirmation from government officials.

President Rodrigo Duterte, who declared martial law in the entire southern province of Mindanao late Tuesday while visiting Moscow, said Wednesday that skirmishes continued with the Maute group, "showing the group's capability to sow terror." He said that a local police chief had been beheaded by the group and that he would consider extending martial law to the entire Philippines if he felt it necessary.

Mr. Hapilon, 51 years old, leads a branch of another terrorist organization, the Abu Sayyaf group, which is known for kidnapping and beheading foreign tourists. His faction, which Mr. Duterte has pledged to destroy, has preoccupied the military since 2014, when he publicly declared loyalty to Islamic State.

"I do think that Hapilon has taken on something of a symbolic importance," said Marc Singer, director of business intelligence at risk consultancy PSA Group in Manila. "Central Mindanao is now a kind of complex chess board where the pieces are all in disarray and you have any number of disparate groups" fighting for influence.

Mr. Hapilon's group hails from the southwestern island of Basilan, but it has brought fighters to the main southern island in Mindanao and raised his profile by striking alliances with other militant groups. Other elements have split off and conducted their own operations, some more ransom-hungry, than Mr. Hapilon's overtly religious focus.

Lawlessness in Mindanao, home to around 22 million people, has become a concern for security services internationally as Islamic State's strongholds in the Middle East are destroyed. Dozens of fighters loyal to the group have fled to the Philippines to join local extremist gangs, seeking a way to continue their fight. Several groups are "auditioning for recognition" by Islamic State, Alan Peter Cayetano, the Philippines' foreign secretary said during a press conference in Russia.

Abu Sayyaf started as a religious splinter group from an independence movement in the Muslim south, loosely allying itself with al Qaeda in the mid-1990s. Its tactics have varied, from kidnapping and murder, to a ferry bombing in 2004 and a bus bombing in Manila in 2005.

The Philippine armed forces, which received assistance from the U.S. after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, have periodically killed Abu Sayyaf leaders and splintered the group further. Now, it survives mostly on kidnappings for ransom and other illicit business, with Mr. Hapilon one of the few leaders with enough seniority to unite members inside and outside Abu Sayyaf itself.

Mr. Hapilon's stature was boosted when Islamic State leadership anointed him as its "emir" in the Philippines. Philippine officials said Mr. Hapilon was wounded in a January airstrike, sparking speculation at the time that he might have been killed.

Mr. Hapilon is on the U.S. Department of Justice list of most-wanted terrorists world-wide with a reward of as much as $5 million. He was personally involved in several kidnappings, including a 2001 incident when 20 people including an American who was later beheaded were taken from a high-end island resort.

The Philippines' inability to dislodge groups such as Abu Sayyaf and Maute has alarmed its neighbors. In February, Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said her country was readying itself for the possibility of Islamic State declaring a caliphate in the southern Philippines.

Yet many security experts play down the capability of Mr. Hapilon and his allies to set up a caliphate, arguing that Mindanao's militant groups are too splintered by ethnicity and ideology to gain the critical mass necessary to gain de facto control of a large amount of territory.

The Maute group, founded by two brothers by that name, rose to notoriety after a series of attacks last year including one in August where gunmen seized control of Butig, a town near Marawi. The military eventually reclaimed the town several days later.

Mr. Hapilon and the Maute group "used the ISIS brand to build a fiercer image," said Joseph Franco, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. "It's like wearing a Che Guevara shirt," he said, but "trying to flash the ISIS creds when the operational links are very tenuous."

Opinion
From 9/11 to Manchester; Donald Trump found out something about the presidency and the world on this trip.

Now we have Manchester and its 22 dead, many of them children. Somehow, we always end up back at 9/11, leaving flowers and candles again.

A political constant since 9/11 is that terrorism inevitably changes U.S. presidencies. I think the events this week—he president's overseas trip and then Manchester—ay have a similar effect on Donald Trump.

On Inauguration Day in January 2001, George W. Bush's mind no doubt was filled with plans for his first term. Months later, his was a war presidency and would remain so.

Several things sit in my memory from the politics of that period. One is President Bush's face as he addressed Congress on Sept. 20. He was a changed man. Also remembered is the solidarity of national purpose after the attack. The final memory is how quickly that unity dissipated into a standard partisan melee.

The Democratic point of attack became the Patriot Act's surveillance provisions, a legal and legislative battle that ran the length of the Bush presidency. By the end of his second term, George Bush had become an object of partisan caricature and antipathy equal to anything President Trump endures now.

During Barack Obama's presidency, four major terrorist attacks took place inside the U.S.: Fort Hood in 2009, the Boston Marathon in 2013, San Bernardino two years later and then Orlando in 2016. During these years, the locus of terror migrated from al Qaeda to Islamic State.

Volumes have been written about Barack Obama and terrorism, much of it about the president's struggles with vocabulary terms such as war, Islam, extreme and radical. The killing of Osama bin Laden evinced a rare, passing moment of national unity.

With the opposition to the Trump presidency programmed for driverless resistance, there will be no national unity in the war on terrorism. The Democrats have become the Trump-Is-Russia Party, and that may be as good a way as any for them to spend their waking hours.

But even Hillary Clinton couldn't duck the terrorism problem in the 2016 presidential campaign, and when Mr. Trump said he would "defeat ISIS," his lack of nuance no doubt won him votes.

Which brings us to Manchester this week and memories of 9/11.

Note the political response to the Manchester murders. Again, total solidarity, such as this from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: "These cowardly attacks will only strengthen our commitment to work together to defeat the perpetrators of such vile acts."

Post-9/11, naturally one expects such commitments to erode like sand castles. But this time, by coincidence, alleged Manchester bomber Salman Abedi murdered concertgoers in the same week Donald Trump was using his first overseas trip to build a coalition to defeat Islamic State.

This was not a routine presidential foreign trip for self-pomp and circumstance. Mr. Trump went to Saudi Arabia to initiate an anti-ISIS policy designed and midwifed by three Trump appointees and Middle East specialists—efense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster.

The policy entails the U.S. sale over 10 years to Saudi Arabia of $450 billion of military equipment—anks, ships, precision-guided bombs—n return for Saudi leadership of an Arab-state coalition, which is their idea, to fight Islamic terrorists in the region and thwart Iran's territorial ambitions.

A New York Times online summary of the speech Mr. Trump delivered Sunday in Riyadh called it "a speech about Islam." I thought it was about something larger than that.

For instance, the Times and Washington Post ran stories about how the Trump foreign policy has demoted human-rights issues. It has not. Implicit in the Trump-Tillerson formulation is that defining the abuse of human rights as oppression by governments, such as Saudi Arabia's, is too narrow. Now, any discourse over human rights must include the right not to have one's life ended by acts of organized terrorism.

Grasping at Trumpian straws is a fact of life, but I am going to hazard not much more than a thought, which is that the president who left for Saudi Arabia last Friday will not be the same president who returns here this weekend.

Delivering that big foreign-policy speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump looked like he was passing through a moment familiar to George W. Bush and other presidents in the post-World War II period—oming to grips with the gravity of why his office matters to the world. Being president isn't enough. Something always has to penetrate the parochial bubble of U.S. politics for this transition to happen, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the Carter presidency.

Mr. Trump meets Thursday in Brussels with NATO allies who since 2015 have experienced Islamic State's mass murders in Paris, Nice, Berlin, Copenhagen, Brussels, Stockholm, London and now Manchester.

His basic message—t's time to get serious—s important and deserves support, both over there and in the White House.

NATO's Vital Role in the War on Terror; The alliance can do even more—ncluding a formal role in the fight against Islamic State.

At first glance, it's simply a fragment of twisted metal outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's new headquarters in Brussels. But this 6-foot-long section of steel girder was recovered from the ruins of the World Trade Center. At its official unveiling Thursday, we will hail the artifact as a symbol of solidarity: Europe and North America standing together.

Two years ago I spoke at the 9/11 Memorial in New York. Being there, at the site of the attacks, reinforced my firm belief that however much terrorists try to divide us, they will only succeed in uniting us.

This is exactly what happened after 9/11. For the first time ever, NATO allies invoked our collective defense clause, Article 5. We recognized those shocking assaults on the U.S. as an attack against us all.

In the days that followed, NATO planes patrolled American skies. Within weeks, troops from NATO allies deployed to Afghanistan to ensure that country would never again be a haven for international terrorists. The biggest combat operation in NATO history was launched in direct response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Since then, hundreds of thousands of Europeans, Canadians and troops from partner countries have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their American comrades in Afghanistan. More than 1,000 have paid the ultimate price. Many more have suffered life-changing injuries.

At this moment, approximately 13,000 troops from 39 NATO and partner countries are training Afghan security forces to stabilize the country. And at a meeting of NATO leaders in Brussels on Thursday we will discuss how we can step up our fight against terrorism.

We never said it would be easy. On my visits to Afghanistan, I have witnessed the challenges, as well as the progress made. I was particularly impressed by my meeting with young Afghan women training to become pilots. I heard them express pride in what they are doing and appreciation for NATO's support.

While NATO's contribution to the fight against terrorism effectively began in Afghanistan, it now extends far wider.

NATO surveillance planes are supporting the coalition to defeat the so-called Islamic State. Iraqi troops trained by NATO to defuse improvised explosive devices are putting their skills to use in the battle for Mosul. We have taught soldiers counterterrorism and counterinsurgency tactics in countries like Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Morocco. And our highly skilled troops are helping Tunisia develop its own special forces.

Earlier this year, we opened a regional center in Kuwait to enhance cooperation with our Gulf partners. We are also developing a new operational hub at our command in Naples, Italy, to improve our ability to anticipate and respond to crises in the region. At our headquarters in Brussels we have set up a new intelligence and security division to improve our understanding of the threats we face.

At the same time, we are strengthening ties with the European Union and United Nations. Both organizations' counterterrorism capabilities complement our own. And we are working hard throughout the alliance to make our societies more resilient to attack.

While I am very proud of what NATO is already doing in the fight against terrorism, I also believe NATO can do more. For instance, we have learned from our experiences in Afghanistan and elsewhere that training local forces is one of the best weapons we have in the fight against terrorism. It is far better, and more sustainable, to help our neighbors to stabilize their countries themselves. And if our neighbors are more stable, we are more secure. These efforts must be expanded.

There are other possibilities. Although NATO has assisted the coalition fighting ISIS, it does not have a formal role. Having one would allow NATO to support political discussions in the coalition. It would also improve coordination, for example, with training and capacity-building activities. It would not mean NATO involvement in combat operations.

We are also considering expanding our support to airspace surveillance for the coalition. An expanded training and capacity-building role for NATO's special forces and the creation of a dedicated counterterrorism intelligence cell are also under consideration.

Terrorism affects every NATO ally. It is a long-term threat to our values, freedom and way of life. And the alliance is ready to do more to counter this threat. The unique bond between Europe and North America has delivered unprecedented peace for almost seven decades, and NATO's role in the fight against terrorism is an important chapter in that story.

Mr. Stoltenberg is secretary-general of NATO.

The Islamic State-Linked Militant Fueling a Violent Philippine Showdown; Isnilon Hapilon leads a branch of the Abu Sayyaf group known for kidnapping and beheading foreign tourists

Militants threatened to kill hostages in Marawi. An earlier version of the article misspelled the name of the city. (May 24)

MANILA—t the center of a gunbattle and hostage standoff between Islamic State-linked militants and government troops in the southern Philippines is a faction leader who is trying to build a caliphate in the troubled region.

Isnilon Hapilon, 51, leads a branch of the Abu Sayyaf group known for kidnapping and beheading foreign tourists. His faction, which President Rodrigo Duterte has pledged to destroy, has preoccupied the Philippine military since 2014, when he publicly declared loyalty to Islamic State.

Mr. Hapilon's group hails from the southwestern island of Basilan, but it has brought fighters to the main southern island in Mindanao and raised his profile by striking alliances with other militant groups. Other elements have split off and conducted their own operations, some more ransom-hungry, than Mr. Hapilon's overtly religious focus.

"I do think that Hapilon has taken on something of a symbolic importance," said Marc Singer, director of business intelligence at risk consultancy PSA Group in Manila. "Central Mindanao is now a kind of complex chess board where the pieces are all in disarray and you have any number of disparate groups" fighting for influence.

A combined police and military operation on Tuesday sought to arrest Mr. Hapilon, sparking a gunfight in the southern city of Marawi. The arrest attempt was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, rebels from the Maute group, another organization aligned with Mr. Hapilon, attacked the city, occupied buildings and waved a black Islamic State flag.

The standoff escalated Wednesday, when a Roman Catholic bishop in Marawi said he received a call from the militants the previous evening. The bishop said they had taken several of his congregation and a priest hostage, according to the official news website of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. The militants threatened to kill the hostages if their demands of a cease-fire and safe passage out of Marawi weren't met, according to the Conference news service. There was no immediate confirmation from government officials.

Mr. Duterte responded to the attack on Marawi during a trip to Moscow by declaring martial law for the entire main southern island of Mindanao, home to around 22 million people. In a press conference in Manila on Wednesday, Mr. Duterte said sporadic skirmishes with the Maute group continued, "showing the group's capability to sow terror." He said a local police chief had been beheaded by the group and that he would consider extending martial law to the entire Philippines if he felt it necessary.

Mindanao's lawless western regions have become a concern for security services internationally as Islamic State's strongholds in the Middle East are destroyed. Dozens of fighters loyal to the group have fled to the Philippines to join local extremist gangs, seeking a way to continue their fight. Several groups are "auditioning for recognition" by Islamic State, Alan Peter Cayetano, the Philippines' foreign secretary said during a press conference in Russia.

Marcin Klis's first name was incorrectly given as Martin in an earlier version of this article. (May 24, 2017)

One died in the blast in a way that shielded her sister and niece. Several were parents waiting to pick up their children.

Friends and family overnight confirmed the identities of more victims of the bombing that claimed 22 lives as thousands of concertgoers, including many children, streamed out of a Manchester, England, arena after watching American pop star Ariana Grande perform.

Ian Hopkins, chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police, said Wednesday afternoon that an off-duty police officer had been among those killed in the bombing. He said he wouldn't release further details at this time, based on the wishes of family members.

Kelly Brewster, a young woman from Sheffield, east of Manchester, was walking behind her sister Claire and niece Hollie when a man identified by police as Salman Abedi detonated an explosive outside Manchester Arena.

She "shielded Hollie and Claire from the damage," Ms. Brewster's uncle Paul Dryhurst told the ITV television network. The mother and daughter are in a hospital having shrapnel removed from their bodies, he added. Ms. Brewster was 32 years old, according to local media reports.

Martyn Hakan Hett, a public-relations manager reported in local media as 29, donned a beige and green button-front shirt with black shorts before heading headed to a pub on Monday to drink Prosecco with his friend Stuart Aspinall in the sunshine, according to a post on Mr. Hett's Facebook page, before heading to the Ariana Grande concert together.

Mr. Hett, who became separated from Mr. Aspinall during the last song, "Dangerous Woman," had been slated to leave for a two-month vacation to the U.S., and had spent the last few days saying goodbye to friends.

"We got the news last night that our wonderful iconic and beautiful Martyn didn't survive," a friend wrote on Twitter. "He left this world exactly how he lived, center of attention."

Friends Alison Howe and Lisa Lees were waiting outside the arena when the bomb exploded. Both women, in their 40s, were waiting for their teenage daughters, according to local media.

"They took a caring beautiful mum and stepmother away from us all," read a Facebook post from Ms. Howe's stepson, Jordan Howe. "She was amazing to us all."

Lee Hunter, Ms. Lees's brother, confirmed her death in a Facebook post late Tuesday. "For those who don't know Lisa is gone but never forgotten I love you Lisa I'll miss you so much," he wrote.

Marcin Klis, a Polish man who worked as a taxi driver in York, northern England, and his wife, Angelika, were also waiting outside the venue for their children when the blast went off.

"Two girls, one of them a grown-up, the other a teenager, were at the concert. The parents drove over after the concert to pick their daughters up," Poland's foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, told local radio station RMF FM on Wednesday. "The children are safe," he added.

Fifteen-year-old Olivia Campbell, from Bury north of Manchester, was also among the victims. "RIP my darling precious gorgeous girl Olivia Campbell taken far far to [sic] soon go sing with the angels and keep smiling mummy loves you so much," read a Facebook post from her mother, Charlotte, posted late Tuesday night.

Ms. Campbell, who like many relatives spent Tuesday frantically appealing for information, tearfully told CNN earlier on Tuesday how Olivia and her best friend had bought new outfits for the event. They were just "normal teenage children going to see one of their favorite artists," she said. "It's ended in absolute carnage."

Jane Tweddle-Taylor, a woman from Blackpool, England, in her early 50s, was also killed after going to the arena with a friend to collect the friend's children.

"Jane was a very, very lovely lady and a very good mother to three daughters, liked by everybody," Ms. Tweddle-Taylor's partner, Mark Taylor, told BBC Radio Lancashire as he choked back tears. The friend and children survived, he said.

A young girl, Megan Hurley, was also identified as a victim by a woman named Helen McDermott from Halewood in Liverpool, northwest England, who set up a fundraising page for the funeral.

The youngest confirmed victim, 8-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos, was named on Tuesday.

Georgina Callander, 18, a devoted fan of Ms. Grande's who had previously met the singer, and John Atkinson, a man in his late 20s, also were identified on Tuesday.

Nell Jones, a 14-year-old student at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in Holmes Chapel, a village southwest of Manchester, was confirmed on Wednesday as having died in the bombings. "We are all devastated by the loss and as a school community we must now come to terms with what has happened," said Denis Oliver, the school's head teacher.

Bomber Kills 22 in Britain ---  ISIS  claims role in suicide attack that targeted fans at pop concert in Manchester

MANCHESTER, England -- U.K. police identified the bomber who killed 22 people and injured dozens of others Monday outside a pop concert in Manchester as a 22-year-old named Salman Abedi.

He hit one of the softest of targets: a mostly young crowd pouring from the exits after the show, police said.

Islamic State said Tuesday it carried out the attack, the deadliest in the U.K. since 2005, but its role couldn't be independently confirmed. Police had no immediate comment on the claim.

As the fans of American singer Ariana Grande streamed out of the Manchester Arena, a single assailant detonated an explosive device and unleashed carnage Monday night, according to the authorities, sending survivors fleeing as panicked parents searched for their children amid the chaos.

Ms. Grande, a former children's TV star who commands an enormous social-media presence, is popular among younger fans. Children were among the dead, and at least 12 children under the age of 16 were among the 59 injured.

School officials confirmed the deaths of two young people, an 18-year-old and an 8-year-old.

Authorities were racing in a fast-moving investigation to determine whether Abedi acted alone or was part of a broader terrorist network, said Manchester's top police officer, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins.

Police cordoned off a street in a south Manchester neighborhood where a bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion and raided an apartment in another neighborhood.

They said they arrested a 23-year-old in a third neighborhood. "I saw someone face down on the floor, and saw men struggling and cuffing him," said Majid Novin, proprietor of a nearby cafe.

It was the second terrorist attack in the U.K. this year and the deadliest since suicide bombers attacked the London transport system nearly 12 years ago, killing 52 people. Monday's bombing took place four years to the day after British soldier Lee Rigby was hacked to death outside an army barracks in London by two Islamic extremists.

In a televised address from Downing Street, Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday's attack stands out for its "appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people."

"Today, let us remember those who died and let us celebrate those who helped, safe in the knowledge that the terrorists will never win and our values, our country and our way of life will always prevail," she said.

Mrs. May met with the government's emergency committee and traveled to Manchester to meet with local leaders and authorities.

Security was heightened around the country. In Manchester, extra police were deployed and armed officers patrolled the city.

U.S. President Donald Trump expressed "absolute solidarity" with the British people. "So many young, beautiful innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life. I won't call them monsters because they would like that term," he said. "I will call them from now on losers, because that's what they are."

In its statement published online, Islamic State said it had planted an improvised explosive device to "terrorize the polytheists" in revenge for their "aggression toward Muslim countries." It identified the assailant only as a "soldier of the caliphate."

A U.S. official in Washington cast doubt on the claim, at least until more information was available. The official said the lack of details suggested the group could be claiming the attack opportunistically, rather than having any real role in its planning.

In its literature, Islamic State has deemed children legitimate targets and identified public gatherings as potential areas for attacks, said Rita Katz, the director of the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist groups.

Two of the members of the Islamic State cell that struck Brussels and Paris in 2015 and 2016 were in Manchester months before the attacks, but a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor said the cases were unrelated.

In March, an attacker authorities said was inspired by Islamist extremism targeted the Parliament, killing five people. The man mowed down pedestrians on a London bridge and fatally stabbed a police officer outside Parliament before he was shot dead.

Monday's explosion went off near the box office around 10:33 p.m. local time in a public space outside the Manchester Arena, according to police. The venue is one of the largest concert arenas in Europe, with a capacity of 21,000.

It came shortly after Ms. Grande had closed her concert with the song "Dangerous Woman," witnesses said. The lights were on and people were leaving, playing and hitting pink balloons released during the show.

The cause of the noise wasn't immediately obvious to many in the crowd.

"There was a bang. Because there were balloons all around the concert, everyone thought it was that," said Charlotte McCluskey, 13, who had been at the arena with her aunt. "Someone came on stage and told us it was just a balloon. Then people from the exits started running back in as we were running to the exit."

"The crowd sort of seemed to part, and people started running," added Dawn Moore, Ms. McCluskey's aunt.

Pictures taken on mobile phones showed concertgoers running from the arena. On social media, users posted dozens of photos of people missing after the explosion.

Ms. Grande tweeted early Tuesday, "broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words." It wasn't known if she would go ahead with planned performances at London's O2 arena on Thursday and Friday.

Carol Bromfield, who came with her daughter Emily to see the concert, said she saw a young girl trampled in the surge as people rushed to flee.

"As we came out of the door, we could see the smoke coming round the auditorium, and we could see the blood on the floor," she added.

The bombing hit in the runup to national elections set for June 8. Mrs. May's Conservative Party and its main rival, Labour, said on Tuesday they would halt campaigning.

The U.K. is raising the terrorism threat level and putting Military personnel at key locations across the country under Operation Temperer. An earlier version of this article incorrectly called it Operation Tempura. Also, Britain's threat level has been at the "severe" level since 2014. It has only been at a "critical" level twice before, in 2006 and 2007. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated both instances occurred in 2006. Khalid Masood, the perpetrator of an attack targeting Britain's Parliament in March, was 52. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said he was 54. (May 23, 2017)

MANCHESTER, England—he British government raised its terrorism threat level to "critical" on Tuesday, suggesting fears of another attack as police identified the suicide bomber who killed 22 people and injured dozens of others in an attack on concertgoers here.

British police gave the suspect's name as Salman Abedi and said he was 22 years old, but declined to provide other details about him. A U.S. law-enforcement official said Abedi was a British citizen of Libyan descent.

Prime Minister Theresa May said security forces were exploring the possibility that "a wider group of people" were involved in the attack. The higher threat level, she said, means "not only that an attack remains highly likely, but that a further attack may be imminent."

Under the heightened alert level, she said, military personnel would replace police officers guarding key places and big events around the country, in an emergency plan called Operation Temperer. "Members of the armed forces deployed in this way will be under the command of police officers," she said.

Britain's threat level has been at the "severe" level since 2014. It has only been at a "critical" level twice before, in 2006 and 2007.

British counterterror chief Mark Rowley said late Tuesday that police raised the threat level because of concern about several investigative leads related to the attack.

"At this stage it is still not possible to be certain if there was a wider group involved in the attack; 24 hours in we have a number of investigative leads that we are pursuing to manage the ongoing threat," he said.

Security officials and experts said the use of explosives in Monday's attack required a higher level of skills and collaboration than in the recent string of vehicle rampages, whether Abedi manufactured the bomb himself or received it from an accomplice.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the deadliest in the U.K. since 2005. British police had no comment on the Islamist extremist group's assertion, and U.S. officials cautioned they hadn't verified any connection between Islamic State and the attack.

Abedi, who grew up in Manchester, lived just miles from the scene of the attack, according to electoral records and neighbors, in a red brick house in a working-class area of south Manchester. Neighbors described him as an aggressive man who didn't mix much with others in the community.

Monday's bombing was a strike on one of the softest of targets: a crowd pouring out after a pop-music performance by a singer especially popular with teenage girls.

As fans of American singer Ariana Grande streamed out of the Manchester Arena, Abedi detonated an explosive device and unleashed carnage, police said, sending survivors fleeing as panicked parents searched for their children amid the chaos.

School officials confirmed the deaths of two young people, an 18-year-old and an 8-year-old. At least 12 children under the age of 16 were seriously injured, authorities said, and others were among the walking wounded. A total of 59 people, adults and children, were hospitalized, some in critical condition, authorities said.

In a televised address, Mrs. May said the attack stood out for its "appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people" and declared that "terrorists will never win."

U.S. President Donald Trump expressed "absolute solidarity" with the British people. "So many young, beautiful innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life," he said.

As police probed Abedi's past and connections, they cordoned off a street in a south Manchester neighborhood and carried out what they called a controlled explosion to enter a home there. They also raided another apartment and arrested a 23-year-old man whom they didn't identify.

"I saw someone face down on the floor, and saw men struggling and cuffing him," said Majid Novin, proprietor of a nearby cafe.

A neighbor said Abedi's family flew a Libyan flag above their house after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime in 2011. Eventually, Abedi's parents returned to the country, according to neighbors, a Libyan counterterrorism official and another person familiar with the family.

While living in Manchester, which is a center of the Libyan diaspora in Britain, Abedi's father would perform the call to prayer at a local mosque, a person at the mosque said.

"We're very sad and devastated at what we've heard. We're just praying for the victims and the innocent people," said a woman in Manchester who identified herself as one of Abedi's relatives. "I heard from his sister that he became religious."

One of Abedi's neighbors, Sandra Locke, said he was an "aggressive man with too much mouth."

"He shouted at us, at my daughter when we wanted to park our cars and he was playing football with his mates on the street," she said.

Libya became a magnet for Islamic State fighters when a U.S.-led coalition began retaking territory captured by the group in Iraq and Syria. The fighters were targeted in Libya by U.S. bombers in January, during the last days of the Obama administration.

In an online statement, Islamic State said the attack was revenge for "aggression toward Muslim countries" and identified the assailant as a "soldier of the caliphate."

As the extremist organization suffers defeats on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq, it has been trying to spur individuals to launch attacks that aren't centrally organized, particularly in Western countries. Its literature has said killing women and children is justified as part of jihad against nonbelievers.

Monday night's terrorist attack was the second in the U.K. this year and the deadliest since suicide bombers attacked the London transport system nearly 12 years ago, killing 52 people. It took place four years to the day after two Islamic extremists hacked a British soldier to death in the capital city.

In March, an attacker authorities said was inspired by Islamist extremism targeted the Parliament, killing five people. The man mowed down pedestrians on a London bridge and fatally stabbed a police officer outside the Parliament before he was shot dead.

Recent terror investigations have focused more heavily on Birmingham and Luton, north of London, which had at one time been home to Khalid Masood, the 52-year-old perpetrator of the March attack. But Manchester has also been in the headlines in recent years.

The northwestern city was long a destination for radical Libyan Islamists during the Ghadafi era, according to records of Libya's intelligence services reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

At least 25 members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group—n Islamist guerrilla group that pledged allegiance to al Qaeda—ought political asylum in Britain and settled in Manchester, the files show.

Two of the members of the Islamic State cell that struck Brussels and Paris in 2015 and 2016 were in Manchester months before those attacks, but a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor said the cases were unrelated to Monday's bombing.

In 2014, teenage sisters Zahra and Salma Halane, who attended Manchester's Whalley Range High School—ust a few minutes' walk from Abedi's house—ecame known as the "terror twins" in the U.K. after leaving to Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria.

On Tuesday evening, thousands gathered for a vigil in front of Manchester's imposing gothic town hall. David Walker, the Anglican bishop of Manchester, called on the crowd, some in tears, to "go to build and rebuild this city."

Holly Atkinson said the gathering was needed. "Tonight shows that we in Manchester can come together when it counts," she said. "When you knock us down we stand back up. And tonight we do it for those who can no longer stand up."

World News: Trump's Visit Wins Saudi Support --- Speech in Riyadh isn't expected to gain Mr. Trump points from other Muslims

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia achieved a measure of foreign-policy success by shoring up U.S. alliances, distracting from the president's domestic difficulties, and sidestepping some of the thornier problems simmering in the region, according to lawmakers and Mideast experts.

In a speech in the Saudi Arabian capital, Mr. Trump challenged the heads of state in the region to help in "honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires," saying terrorists should be driven "out of this earth." Mr. Trump also said "all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism," without providing concrete details of U.S. strategy toward Tehran.

"This is someone who is making it clear that we're making common cause with those who are prepared to take on ISIS and the Iranians," said Dennis Ross, a former U.S. envoy in the region and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Mr. Trump's messages were received warmly by the leaders in the region because their governments are some of the biggest targets for terrorism and are also under pressure from Iran, which supports militants in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

"It is to some extent preaching at the choir," said Anthony Cordesman, strategy chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "All of this sends a kind of message about American resolve and American concern for its Arab allies."

The visit served as reassurance for Saudi Arabia and allied nations after former President Barack Obama appeared to seek closer relations with Iran while negotiating a nuclear agreement with the country, and after the 2016 presidential campaign raised questions about the U.S. appetite for foreign entanglements.

Mr. Trump's decision to visit Saudi Arabia and Israel before other countries -- and his warm rhetoric for their leadership -- signals a shift away from Mr. Obama's policy in the region, which Mr. Trump has blamed for the turmoil there.

The trip also shows Mr. Trump appears eager to use his international authority to work with allies and court success on the global stage as he faces political headaches back home that may hamper his domestic goals,said Aaron David Miller,a former senior State Department official now at Washington's Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

In his speech Sunday, Mr. Trump had to strike a balance between cooperation with the majority-Muslim countries and loyalty to his domestic political base, which includes supporters who backed his campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.

"He got in and out of the speech conundrum fairly well," Mr. Miller said. "He made a few of the right points, missed many of the bad ones, dodged the bullet on formulations of 'radical Islamic terrorism' that could be seen as terribly offending."

The speech in Riyadh isn't likely to win Mr. Trump support among Muslims. "One speech cannot outweigh years of anti-Muslim rhetoric and policy proposal," saidNihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy organization.

Some of Mr. Trump's political partners also were turned off. Roger Stone, a Republican operative who was closely involved with Mr. Trump's campaign, responded to a photograph of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud placing a medal around the president's neck by writing on Twitter: "Candidly, this makes me want to puke."

Mr. Trump avoided sensitive issues of human rights, repressive regimes and official support for Muslim clerics in the region who inspire some militant extremists. The absence of a human-rights discussion drew quick criticism from Democratic and Republican lawmakers.

"I think this is a broader element of the administration's policy, that they're going to de-emphasize issues of human rights -- that what countries do within their own boundaries, we're essentially going to look the other way," said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.).

Paul Gigot: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm Paul Gigot.

Months of turmoil in Washington capped off this week with the appointment of a special counsel in the Russia probe. After weeks of political pressure, deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, announced Wednesday that Robert Mueller would lead the investigation, giving the former FBI director sweeping powers to look into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and, quote, "related matters."

President Trump reacted to the decision on Thursday.

President Donald Trump: I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt, and there is no collusion between, certainly, myself and my campaign. But I can only speak for myself and the Russians, zero. I think it divides the country. I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things.

Gigot: Joining the panel this week, "Wall Street Journal" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Washington columnist, Kim Strassel; editorial board member, Joe Rago; and assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.

So, Kim, a special counsel here. Let's talk about the decision first. We can talk about Mueller later. The decision, first, good or bad?

Kim Strassel: Not good, because special prosecutors, special counsels have a potential to go on and on for years. They take things out of sight of the public. And the bigger problem is they often come in with the belief that it is their job to nail somebody in the end. And so whether or not you have a crime that matters or what they were set out to investigate in the first place is often not what comes out of a special counsel investigation.

Gigot: Now, yeah, Dan, that's the problem, the fundamental lack of political accountability in the sense that, though technically Rod Rosenstein could fire the special counsel, in practical terms, because of this probe, because of how it was created, you really can't do that.

Dan Henninger: Well, that's right. I mean, Rod Rosenstein said a couple of things about this special prosecutor that I think are worth drawing attention to. He talked about appointing a special prosecutor because it was necessary to bring that person out of the chain of command, make him independent from the chain of command. To me, that was an oblique reference to the White House and keeping him independent from any conceivable pressure. The other thing he said is, owing to the unique circumstances, he was appointing a special counsel. This is a wholly political case. And I think a lot of pressure should be brought on Mr. Mueller to expedite this investigation, get it done by next summer because, otherwise, he's going to head into that midterm election, and we're going to be right back where we were with James Comey and the 2016 presidential election.

Gigot: I have to say, Dan, I've lived through a lot of these special counsels, and since then, when these are done within the Justice Department, they don't take a couple of months.

Henninger: They take couple of years.

Gigot: Sometimes longer.

James Freeman: Right. Because this person effectively has no boss. Bob Mueller will not be reporting to anyone on a day-to-day basis. It's basically up to him how long and at what cost he wants to look at really just about anything at all that he decides is in some way related. I would hope that we would remember that this was supposed to be -- it was, at the start, it supposed to be about this Russia collusion claim. We're a year into this story, and we're still waiting for the evidence. You would think it would have come out by now at one of these congressional inquiries.

Gigot: What about the choice of Mueller, Joe? He's a former FBI director, he served in Vietnam, he's known as a -- his record at the FBI was not a grandstander, he didn't seek out the press. Is there some -- and he's 72 years old, so he's not looking for the next job. Is there a possibility here that he could be the exception to the rule of counsels where he acts in a responsible way, and if there's no charges to be brought, he won't go seeking them?

Joe Rago : Yeah. I mean, he's a man of great integrity, widely respected by both parties. So there is a chance here, I think, if the Trump administration has a little bit more discipline, a little bit more organization --

Gigot: That's funny.

Rago: They can say, look, the investigation's ongoing, we're not going to comment, we're going to defer to Bob Mueller. The only thing I would raise is that he's very close with Jim Comey, and so despite his reputation, that's something where you kind of go, huh. Maybe somebody with a little bit more independence should have been selected --

Gigot: Yeah, Kim, you wrote about that. That's a real question, I think. He and Comey worked together in the Justice Department during the Bush years. I think they even threatened to resign together over the warrantless wiretapping --

Strassel: Yeah.

Gigot: -- episode back then and putting it under legal -- the legal basis they wanted it put under. Does this concern you at all?

Strassel: Yeah, especially because, look, here's the thing, if you look at that letter that Rosenstein said that appoints Mueller, it says he's charged with investigating Russian interference in the election but also any other thing that comes from that. What comes from that now is this question of Jim Comey, whether or not he was fired, as some people claim, by the Trump administration for looking into this probe or whether, as the Trump administration says, just because he was incompetent. Mueller's going to have to look at the question of Jim Comey, and the question, too, of whether the FBI or other intelligence agencies were behind the unmasking of and leaking of American citizens' names. So he's going to be investigating a lot of people he used to work with and who used to work for him. Can he be objective about that?

Gigot: Yeah, that's a very big ask, Dan.

Now let's step back a bit. There are some people who say, look, this is great for Republicans because it means you can now say, particularly on Capitol Hill, look, this is taken care of over here. We'll ignore that. Anytime they're asked about it, don't comment. Just say Mueller's doing it and let's get on with business. Do you buy that?

Henninger: Well, it would be nice to believe that, and they should get on with business, because they better put up something on the board to show for it. But we live in a different media era, and all of these media outlets are in competition with one another on this story, and they keep squeezing their sources, which nobody can identify, and I think there's going to be continued, constant coverage of this that's going to distract and siphon energy out of Congress. So they're going to have a very difficult time getting themselves to focus on the president's legislative agenda.

Gigot: And it's not only Mueller that's doing this. You've also got the House and Senate Intelligence Committee investigations. You've got them looking into James Comey and his memos. And I think you're going to see these Comey memos leak one after another after another if they contain any information that potentially damages Trump.

Freeman: Yeah. I think James Comey did not follow protocol, did not do what a prosecutor should do. You look at the Hillary Clinton investigation, kind of textbook case of what not to do. But at media relations, he has always been absolutely top notch.

So I think these leaks will continue. Associates of Comey, sharing all kinds of claims about Donald Trump. But I think one thing, not great news for Republicans, that Mueller has been appointed, but now that it's happened, I think the silver lining is it does allow them to say, not our issue, and it takes away their excuse not to do tax reform, not to get health care done.

Gigot: All right, let's go. Much more ahead as we recap a very busy week in Washington, including the fallout from President Trump's Oval Office meeting with the Russians.

H.R. McMaster : What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged.

Gigot: National security adviser, H.R. McMaster, Tuesday calling President Trump's actions wholly appropriate following a "Washington Post" report that the president shared classified information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during their Oval Office meeting last week.

We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, Joe Rago and James Freeman.

I want to get to this Russian business, Joe, but first, let's go back to James Comey and those memos, those notes he wrote to himself about his meeting with Trump, where he asserts that in the notes, according to partial reading of the notes from Comey associates to the "The New York Times," he said Trump told him to let it go, referring to Michael Flynn's - - the investigation of former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Democrats are saying obstruction of justice. What do you think?

Rago: Well, I think if Comey thought contemporaneously that it was an obstruction of justice, he had a duty to report it to his superior, Rod Rosenstein, and if he really thought his investigation of the Russian nexus was being obstructed, he had an obligation to resign.

Gigot: Now, when you say "obligation," this is not just simply a moral obligation, though that is part of it. This is a legal obligation. If you are somebody in the Justice Department who thinks somebody is trying to block an investigation, you must report it to others in the Justice Department. And as somebody who's leading the investigation, you should resign.

Rago: That's right. It's not just --

Gigot: Yeah. That's not just casual, well, oh, maybe if I feel like it.

Rago: Right. It's not a party of protocol or whatever. It's a legal obligation. And instead he kind of wrote these memos to himself as an insurance policy if something happened to his job. And I think it's another example of Comey acting politically in the sense of preserving his own --

Gigot: Yeah. It kind of gives him the option of saying, well, I can use this someday to tell my story, and it's really almost unseemly in some respects.

Henninger: Well, unseemly would be one word. I can't imagine what our viewers listening to this or people out in the country watching it must think is going on. It is so Machiavellian, so Byzantine, and this is a young, new presidency trying to operate. The president contributes to some of these problems. But you can see a Beltway establishment sort of coming together to simply try to undermine the White House at this moment. I'm not sure they're set up quite well enough to fight back against this torrent that's coming at them from things like the Comey leaks.

Gigot: If there were real obstruction of justice, OK, fine. Let's investigate that. We're not trying to cover it up at all. But Comey, apparently, didn't think it was.

Freeman: Right. Whatever "it" was, because, let's remember, this whole story runs contrary to what Comey has testified to, what acting FBI Chief McCabe has testified to, that there wasn't political interference, that they were able to do their job. So there's a lot of reason the doubt this. The White House has denied it. But if it's true, in some fashion, that the president was urging him to back off on an investigation, that would be disturbing, and that brings memories of President Obama with the Clinton administration.

Gigot: All right, Kim, let's go back to the Russian story and the fact that Trump seems to have confirmed that he shared some secrets about an aviation plot with Lavrov. How big a deal is this?

Strassel: Look, it's not as big a deal as many people in the press are suggesting it is. It would appear that the information that he passed on had come from an Israeli source. That was sort of the concern, was this might undermine Israel's ability to continue with some of its intelligence operations. That does not seem to be the case.

Also, by the way, we do share intelligence with Russians, the Obama administration did it as well, given the relationship between the United States and Russia, vis-a-vis ISIS and some actions in Syria, for instance. So it's not unheard of.

That being said, it does seem pretty clear that President Trump seemed to maybe do this on the spur of the moment, and that does raise some questions about how much thought he's giving before he's going into these meetings with world leaders.

Gigot: Yeah. It plays into the stereotype of Trump as the impulsive, inexperienced guy who blurted out because, well, he likes to brag about what he knows, Joe.

Rago: Right. You don't think I have great intelligence? I've got the best intelligence. So it appears that he did not compromise intelligence sources and methods, which is good. But the entire way that this was handled was, I guess I would say sub-professional.

Gigot: Dan?

Henninger: Well, look, I mean, they say that we broke relations with the Saudis and the Israelis over this. Let me tell you, Israel and Saudi Arabia couldn't be happier to be dealing with President Obama after what they went through with -- with President Trump after what they went through with President Obama.

Gigot: All right, thank you, gentlemen.

After we come back, President Trump leaving the White House turmoil behind as he embarks on his first foreign trip. Ambassador John Bolton joins us next with a look at the challenges and opportunities awaiting the president abroad.

President Trump: I will make my first trip abroad as president with the safety, security and interests of the American people as my priority. I will strengthen all friendships and will seek new partners. But partners who also help us, not partners who take and take and take.

Gigot: President Donald Trump this week previewing his first trip abroad during the U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement in New London, Connecticut. The president kicking off his nine-day trip with a stop in Saudi Arabia, then continuing on to Israel and Rome, before a NATO meeting in Brussels and a G-7 summit in Sicily.

John Bolton is the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a FOX News contributor.

Ambassador, welcome.

John Bolton: Glad to be with you.

Gigot: First, let's take on this Russian intelligence story. You worked for other presidents. Sometimes they share intelligence with other presidents, do they not?

Bolton: Amazingly, yeah. And, you know, if you look at what's been reported about the so-called leak, taking the worst case as I've seen it, he told the Russians that Israel has an agent inside ISIS in Raqqa, which is the capital of the caliphate there, which is roughly saying that China has an agent in the U.S. government in Washington. Well, where else do you think the agent would be? And we don't know whether Israel hasn't shared this intelligence with Russia already. They have a relationship on the terrorist front that could well encompass that.

Gigot: You know, my issue is why was he meeting with Lavrov at all? He shouldn't have been meeting him that week when he fired Comey, but why given what Russia is doing to our interests abroad?

Bolton: I think, unfortunately, it was presented to the president as an equivalent to Rex Tillerson meeting with Putin in Moscow, that is Putin received our secretary of state, Trump had to receive Lavrov. I would have rejected that parallel, especially given the circumstances.

Gigot: OK. Let's talk about the president's trip. First stop, Saudi Arabia. Highly unusual for the first foreign trip to be this Saudi Arabia. I can't remember that ever happening before. What do you think the president is trying to accomplish here by meeting with the Saudis first?

Bolton: Well, I think he has a dramatic opportunity to put to rest the line of chatter in this country that he's anti-Muslim, he's trying to ban Muslims from the country. He can talk about Islamic terrorism. After all, the king of Jordan said it's a civil war within Islam. People have already begun to compare this speech the president intends to give with Barack Obama's Cairo address in 2009, to see the differing ways of handling the terrorist threat in the Islamic world. And then I think by going directly from Saudi to Israel he demonstrates that there's a lot going on in this most-important bilateral relationship between Israel and the United States, a world of difference from the Obama years, and the direct contrast with Iran.

Gigot: Right. And that's what I wanted to ask about. By going to the Saudis first, he is -- is this -- does this mark the end of what I would call the Obama tilt to Iran, to the Shiite Islamic world, and back towards a more traditional U.S. relationship where we are closer to the Sunni Arabs in the gulf states, but also in Egypt and elsewhere?

Bolton: Well, [speaking a foreign language] -- as they say -

And he is going to meet with the Gulf Cooperation Council, heads of state in Saudi Arabia. So this is a very, I think, well-planned-out --

Gigot: But do you see that tilt, do you see the Trump administration tilting away from Iran and back towards the Sunni Arabs?

Bolton: I have to say, not yet.

Gigot: No?

Bolton: I think the amazing thing is the continuity with respect at least to the nuclear deal from the Trump administration and Iran. The secretary of state certifying Iranian compliance with the deal, which I find absolutely incredible in the literal sense. Incredible.

And then, this past week, extending the waiver on certain critical economic sanctions held over from the Obama administration. So it's directly continuous. They say the policy on the Iran deal, the nuclear deal is under review –

Gigot: Yeah, that's what they're saying, we want to extend these because we want to do these things comprehensively and it's under review. That was the argument there.

Bolton: But it sends a terrible signal. The compliance certification sends a worse signal because it's contrary to fact.

Gigot: Let's talk about one item on his route. The president in the campaign promised I will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Of all the promises he made in the campaign, that was one of the clearest. And yet, now, he's saying, the administration is saying we're not going to do that. Is that a mistake?

Bolton: Yes, it is, and it reflects, I'm afraid, the dominance of the State Department thinking that infuses the advice that the White House is getting. Look, the argument is that the final status of Jerusalem is the subject of negotiation.

Gigot: Right.

Bolton: OK, fine. Does anybody seriously think anything behind the 1949 green line that Israel held then will go to the Palestinians? Of course not. Is Jerusalem manifestly Israel's capital? Yes, it is. As the Russians recognized this fairly recently. You pointed that out in an op-ed in the "Wall Street Journal." Will our embassy be built in west Jerusalem territory, unquestionably Israeli? Yes. So what is the problem?

Gigot: Well, the argument is that if the president does that, this will blow up any chance of having a Palestinian agreement, because the Palestinians will rise up in horror and say, this is unacceptable.

Bolton: You know, this is another legend about the Arab street. We're constantly waiting for the Arab street to explode. It's a recognition of reality. Occasionally, foreign policy should be based on reality.

It's incredible that anybody can tell the United States where to put its diplomatic representation in a bilateral relationship like this.

Gigot: Why is it that every single president in my lifetime has believed that he had the secret sauce to get a Palestinian peace? He was the one who was going to do the deal. And now we have Donald Trump. He's now got it. He's the great negotiator. What is it?

Bolton: I think it's the challenge. It's the Mt. Everest of international diplomacy.

Gigot: But these things have to come up -- peace has to come up organically from the parties in the region.

Bolton: Jim Baker put it best. He said, once testifying, he said, "Here's the phone number at the White House. When the parties are ready for peace, give us a call."

I say Donald Trump's an optimistic man. God bless him. It's not going to happen.

Gigot: It's not going to happen, no matter how much Rex Tillerson tries.

Bolton: Or anybody else.

Gigot: Thank you, Ambassador.

Bolton: Thank you.

Gigot: Good to be here. Glad to have you here.

Still ahead, a stock selloff amid fears that is the White House turmoil will derail the GOP's tax cut plan. So can Republicans in Congress keep their agenda on track?

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell : We could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things so that we can focus on our agenda.

House Speaker Paul Ryan : I think people in America turn on the TV, and they think this is all that's happening, this is all we're doing and all we're discussing. That's just not the case. I want the American people to know that we're busy, hard at work fixing their problems. We're going to walk and chew gum at the same time. We're going to keep doing our jobs, we're going to passing our bills, we're going to keep advancing our reforms, and that's what we will be judged in 2018.

Gigot: House Speaker Paul Ryan addressing the ongoing controversies engulfing the White House and vowing not to let it interfere with the GOP's agenda in Congress. Still, stocks saw their biggest one-day selloff since Trump took office Wednesday as fears grow that tax reform and other Republican priorities will stall amid the turmoil.

So, Dan, you heard the speaker. Is he whistling past the Trump graveyard when it comes to the agenda?

Henninger: No, I don't think so. He described things accurately, but there's a couple of additional point it is make. Opinion polls show that Trump supporters still support him, upwards of 70 percent. And I think a lot that means that's not so much they support Donald Trump. They voted for him for his agenda, which is what Congress is supposed to do. And you've got, at issue, the control of Congress, of the House in the 2018 election. They are not going to vote for these Republicans if, as Speaker Ryan was just saying, they are shown to have been working on their behalf. They're going to have to accomplish something on their behalf, and that means getting Obamacare repeal and replace passed, the tax reform bill passed, and getting spending under control. I think some of these members are going to have to trim back on the politicking. They're going to have to get these things passed so that they can run on them.

Gigot: Now, Joe, you were down this Washington this week, you met with the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and a half dozen other Senators or so. What's the mood down there?

Rago: I would say it's compartmentalized.

Gigot: What do you mean?

Rago: Well, in the sense that they've got to respond to the Russia stuff, the FBI stuff, this sort of swirling controversy all around them. But as an escape, they're looking at policy. And they're actually focusing on the substance, trying to craft a health care bill that can actually get 50 votes in the Senate and then actually become law.

Gigot: But can they do that with all of this incoming, you know, this over their heads and their ducking and covering, and they walk out and there's camera crews saying, what do you think of the latest story, sir? Should he be impeached?

Rago: I mean, they're certainly trying. The thing is Washington can really only handle one big thing at a time.

It's like they just don't have the bandwidth to cover all this stuff. And so I think there is a sense of exhaustion that's starting to set in, like every night at six when the new story breaks, it's like, oh, what is it this time.

Gigot: And I guess, Kim, that time is of the essence here. Certainly, that's my view. Every day this goes on, you're losing a day where you could -- you have the chance to move ahead with the agenda, and the closer you get to the election, panic is more likely to set in. And right now, I mean, if the president's approval rating stays at 38 percent or so or under 40, and you go into November 2018 with that, the House Republican majority is in jeopardy. So if they want to get something done, they need to get it done fast.

Strassel: Yeah. And here's the problem, Paul, is that Paul Ryan is correct, they can walk and chew gum at the same time. But only part of this is negotiating a bill behind the scenes. You want to really pass this, you have to sell it to the public. And that means it has to be out on the airwaves. And right now, there is just no capacity to do that selling, because everyone's talking about the White House problems. And somebody, I think, at some point, needs to get this message across to Donald Trump. It is remarkable, if you look back over the past four months, there has been very little criticism of Donald Trump on his actual policy agenda. Almost all of it is self-caused drama over something he said or something he tweeted.

Gigot: Well, and it's not just, Dan, your point about getting the legislative agenda passed. It's also that's only insurance the Republicans have, protection that they have, against being identified with all of the Trump drama. Is actually saying, we passed these things, see? It didn't matter. We could do these things and get it done, so re-elect us next time because, look, these are the results you wanted, you got them.

Freeman: Yeah. And it's not just how they sell it, it is not just their political presentation. They need to get a big tax cut done this year if they want the economy to be moving to a higher growth level next year.

Gigot: I have to tell you, James, I don't think that tax cut's going to happen.

Freeman: Well, this is the problem. They're now talking about the winter or and maybe it'll be next year. And what they need to do is stop making excuses, stop whining about how they've got to respond to every tweet. I know it's a challenge, but you have a president who is ready to sign a big tax cut. Put it on his desk, and that will sell itself as people get more jobs and higher incomes next year.

Gigot: Yeah, but I'm going to --

Freeman: That's how you maintain congressional majorities.

Gigot: Why has the stock market taken the plunge it has? It's the Trump slump, not the Trump rally.

Freeman: No, basically, it's like a law of physics. Whenever investors think that the Trump agenda of lower taxes and deregulation is going to get enacted, stocks go up. The big hit this week was when it looked like politics was going to interfere with that program, stocks went down. So the market is sending Republicans a very strong message: Here is how you save yourselves and get reelected, pass a big tax rut right now.

Gigot: Briefly, anybody disagree with that?

Henninger: No. Short version, this is what happens when the market thinks Nancy Pelosi's going to become speaker.

Gigot: All right, Dan, thank you very much.

Still ahead, Purdue University embracing online learning and changing the landscape of higher education with a deal that is stirring up its share of controversy. Purdue president and former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels is here to answer his critics, next.

Gigot: When Indiana's Purdue University announced last month it would acquire for-profit Kaplan University, it shocked many people in higher education and set off a fierce debate over the deal. The agreement will allow Purdue to increase its reach into online and adult learning, and access some 32,000 current Kaplan students. In exchange, Kaplan will collect 12.5 percent of the revenue from the new venture for 30 years. Some are hailing the deal by Purdue as bold, a necessary move as public universities get squeezed by shrinking state funding. But critics are calling it a dangerous marriage between a public university and a firm that answers to private investors.

Former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels is the president of Purdue University. He joins me now.

Welcome.

Mitch Daniels: Hi, Paul.

Gigot: So you have, you purchased Kaplan for $1. Why would going concern sell itself to Purdue for a buck?

Daniels: I wanted 50 cents in the negotiations. We settled out. They'll have a chance the it's successful through a services agreement, they're going to do the back- office stuff. All the academics will be overseen and controlled by --

Gigot: But they'll do marketing, too, right?

Daniels: Under our supervision, strict supervision.

Gigot: OK.

Daniels: But if it's successful, then over the course of time, they will earn out the value that they built in a really fine university over the course of a couple decades.

Gigot: There's the sense they just couldn't make it as a for-profit institution, and they need to move under their auspices?

Daniels: They've spoken for themselves, so I think I'm within my rights to recap that they felt that the -- their mission -- and they're very idealistic about their mission. It's important to note, the average student they're serving is a female, three-quarters are, 33 years old, as likely to be minority as not. 55 percent are first-generation college students. And they felt they could serve that mission better freed from what they feel is the unfair stigma of a multi-year onslaught from the federal government.

Gigot: That's what I wanted to get at. This is actually shrewd in the sense that it's an act of regulatory arbitrage. Let me explain what I mean. You are a nonprofit, Purdue, a public university. You're not subject to all the rules the Obama administration imposed on for-profits. Right? It's the debt forgiveness rule, the gainful employment rule. That really limits their running room. By going to Purdue, they're all freed from that.

Daniels: Yeah, you know, it's -- I've never thought that business form was -- should be the test. To me, it's the results you're getting or not getting. There are a lot of nonprofits that are not getting near as good of results as Kaplan has been. But what you say is true. For whatever reasons, the federal government's focus was entirely on the proprietary sector. And, you know, even though that may not be the case in the new administration, the folks at Kaplan were pretty forthright in saying they thought they'd be better off partnered with a university like ours. And I do hope it has something to do -- they sure say it does -- with the quality that's always been associated with Purdue University and the standards we hold ourselves to.

Gigot: Well, why does pursue and, granted, that quality and reputation, why does Purdue need an online presence to expand? You have, what, how many students on campus, 40,000?

Daniels: On the main campus, 31,000 undergrads and 10,000 graduate students, and more at our regional campuses, which we've had for six decades.

Gigot: Why the online expanded presence? Particularly, look, quality control is always an issue with the management of any new acquisition.

Daniels: Two main reasons. One, although, a lot of people don't know this, we are a land-grant school. We take that very seriously. Abe Lincoln and his allies put us there explicitly to democratize the higher education, to open to it up beyond the wealthy and the privileged. In this era, when there are tens of millions of Americans who missed a chance at a postsecondary degree the first time around, we cannot honor that mission if we stop at age 22. So that's number one.

Gigot: And these online student, a lot of them, are full-time workers, so they're doing this at night, on weekends. They're mid-career people.

Daniels: Almost all of these are working adults. I gave you the demographics a little while ago. Those people will simply never be able to move for four years to a campus like ours for four years or even -- except for those who happen to live close to one of our regional campuses. So it's either go to an online platform or not serve them at all.

And the other thing, Paul, is I don't pretend to know the exact direction or trajectory of the online phenomenon. But I know it's not going to get any smaller. And I did not want my successor 10 years from now to look back and say how could they miss this? What were they thinking? Why do we not have the ability to use these tools as well as anyone? And so that's - - that was the other part.

Gigot: Well, you know, I can tell you, being in the newspaper business, the Internet has a big effect.

Daniels: Well, it didn't escape -- higher Ed has felt it, but what sector didn't?

Gigot: I know.

Daniels: We're different, we're bulletproof, and, you know, I'm just not so sure.

Gigot: So you think the traditional four-year college, with tuition that is, in some cases, $50,000 $60,000, not Purdue, for instance, but nonetheless, it is high, that is going to be dis-intermediated -- pardon the jargon phrase -- just like a lot of other industries.

Daniels: Yeah, we'll see. I still believe there will be an important role for those residential institutions who can unimpeachably add value that can't be delivered at home. I like to talk to his friends at Purdue about the pajamas test. I say, you know, we've got to have features here, direct contact with faculty and coaching, participation in research, would be another good example, leadership opportunities, that can't be delivered at home, because a lot of smart people are saying to folks just sit home in your bathrobe, I'll bring the best teachers in the world to you. And I think to be dismissive of that would be to invite the kind of difficulties that your industry and others have had.

Gigot: Briefly, you going to bring along the faculty on this? There's some grousing.

Daniels: Well, some. But, you know, the faculty, we're now swarmed with faculty who have ideas of their own, who want to take part, who have a course they might like to put online. So as in anything, the questions that were asked were good questions, there were good answers to them. And if you were to survey our faculty as a whole, I think you'd find a lot of excitement about this.

Gigot: Thank you, Governor Daniels. Appreciate it.

When we come back, as Amazon celebrates its 20th anniversary, a look at how the online giant changed the face of retail.

Gigot: Amazon celebrated its 20th anniversary this week. The online retail giant went public on May 15, 1997. And in two decades, has gone from selling books and C.D.s to groceries, clothing, furniture, jewelry, just about everything else. Today, the company is worth about, oh, just $460 billion, almost twice as much as brick-and-mortar king, Walmart. And if you were lucky enough to buy $1,000 of Amazon stock on that first day 20 years ago, it would be worth more than $490,000 today.

We're back with Dan Henninger, James Freeman and Joe Rago.

So, James, knowing that you had the wisdom to be an investor 20 years ago - - sorry, I know --

Freeman: Yeah, yeah, not quite.

Gigot: What do you make, what are the lessons of Amazon's success?

Freeman: Well, some of them are very -- a lot of them very encouraging in terms of what the Internet, largely unregulated to this point, thank goodness, has allowed in terms of new companies, new business models, new competition. It's been -- Amazon has been very tough on competitors but great for consumers because it has been a kind of a relentless force to offer more convenience and lower prices.

And also, a lesson here about the value of our public markets. And this has kind of changed over the years where you don't have so many coming to the public where individual investors can own them.

Gigot: Flip side of that, if you put a buck in Macy's 20 years ago, do you know what it would be worth now? A buck.

Freeman: A buck.

Gigot: As opposed to $400--

Henninger: Here's an ironic lesson of the market, Paul, which is, the "Wall Street Journal" took a look at this, and $1,000 of Amazon turning into $490,000, almost nobody did that. Nobody held Amazon from start to finish because that stock went up and down like a roller coaster.

Gigot: Except Bezos.

Henninger: Except Bezos, exactly. He believes in this platform, and he emphasized growth over growth in the share price over that time. But, I mean, there's very few people who have kind of cashed in on Amazon. But he had great belief in his idea.

Gigot: But my point, Joe, is about the disruption. And retail, you can see it. There's, you know, malls, the cornerstone, the big department store that used to be the cornerstone of malls in America, that's fading away. A lot of these companies are really under pressure because people are shopping at home. So there's a lot of turmoil within the retail marketplace.

Rago: Well, there is a lot of turmoil, but you have to ask, are consumers better off? It's not like, because the mall closed, they're being deprived of books and music and all the rest of it. And you need that disruption in an economy to keep it dynamic. I mean, if you just go down the list of things that Amazon has disrupted, it's not only Macy's.

Gigot: Right.

Rago: I mean, it's Walmart, Apple, Google, Netflix. I mean, you can just go down the line, and it's one after another.

Gigot: The capital markets point, James, you know, they're not as dynamic now as they were 20 years ago. There are a lot fewer companies like Amazon, which went public at a relatively early stage so that average investors could buy a share in them and write it up. Now more and more of these company are waiting longer because they just don't want to go public because their costs are too great.

Freeman: Yeah. It's not fun being the CEO of a public company in the way it used to be. The burdening Sarbanes-Oxley is the big one. But there are others. Lots of both laws and regulations over the last 20 years that have made it much more difficult, everything from accounting to how you can talk to investors, and the circumstances, and what you can disclose. This is a problem that we've made it very difficult and cumbersome if you want to be owned by owned by mom-and-pop investors as opposed to private equity.

Gigot: To put a number on that, the new head of the SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, said there's 37 percent fewer public companies now than 20 years ago?

Freeman: Yeah. That's not a healthy market. I mean, you -- it's not that Washington ought to have a set number in mind, but certainly, a growing economy, you'd want more companies, more opportunities to invest.

Gigot: All right. We have to take one more break. When we come back, "Hits Misses" of the week.

Gigot: Time for our "Hits Misses" of the week.

Kim, start us off.

Strassel: So, Paul, Chelsea Manning, formerly Private Bradley Manning, walked out of a military prison this week having served only seven years of a 35-year sentence for perpetrating one of the biggest leaks of classified information in the country's history. This happened because Barack Obama commuted the sentence. That is my miss. If you want to know every newspaper every day is full of classified leaks, it is because the people at the top are sending message that it is perfectly OK to do that. And until we make examples of people, it will continue.

Gigot: All right.

Joe?

Rago: Paul, a hit this week to Chobani Yogurt Company, which successfully sued to get an apology from the Internet conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. The yogurt company has helped resettle refugees in Idaho, and Jones and his website spread just vicious falsehoods about abetting criminality and other abuses. Defamation lawsuits are often abused but, in this case, it was necessary to vindicate reality and strike a blow against fake news.

Gigot: All right.

James?

Freeman: Paul, this is miss to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who for some reason is going to march in a parade next month at which a convicted terrorist, Oscar Lopez Rivera, will be honored with an award. Obviously, de Blasio has set the bar very low in his tenure here, but this is -- really should be beyond that for him.

Gigot: All right.

Dan?

Henninger: I'm going to give at hit to the last bastion of anti-Communism in America, California, believe it or not. A California legislator introduced a bill that said that you could officially and legally hire Communists in the California government. In California, you would think that would fly right through? But, no, he had to pull the bill because of opposition from, guess what? Vietnamese Americans who had fled Communism in Vietnam, and from veterans who had served in Vietnam. Good for them.

Gigot: Did they have to remind the legislature what Communism is?

Gigot: At this stage? It's been around a while.

Henninger: I suspect they are already serving in the California government, but this makes it official.

Gigot: And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC.

That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you here next week.

U.S. News: In Budget, Foreign Grants Would Become Loans

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's budget proposal this week will include provisions to end many foreign military grants administered by the State Department and replace them with loans, a move that could affect up to $1 billion in aid to dozens of countries if Congress approves, U.S. officials said.

An internal State Department memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal names Pakistan, Tunisia, Lebanon, Ukraine, Colombia, the Philippines and Vietnam as among countries that could be affected.

Typically, the State Department's Office of Security Assistance receives about $6 billion to dispense as military aid grants. That sum includes $3.1 billion for Israel, about $350 million for Jordan and about $1.3 billion for Egypt. Those grants will be preserved in the 2018 budget, officials said.

Pakistan, which usually receives about $265 million in grant assistance, will see that number go down to about $100 million under the new budget, officials said.

Most other countries will see their assistance converted from grants to loans.

The grants have allowed countries to buy U.S. equipment such as ammunition, vehicles and naval boats.

Mr. Trump's administration is set to release his full budget proposal Tuesday. The administration is considering cuts of up to 31% to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Journal has reported.

Mr. Trump's budget is expected to propose large cuts to domestic programs and safety-net spending, such as Medicaid, food assistance and other antipoverty efforts, to curb deficits over the coming decade without touching the largest drivers of federal spending -- Social Security and Medicare.

Altogether, the budget will seek to reduce funding by $1.7 trillion over a decade to entitlement programs such as Medicaid and food assistance, whose use swelled after the 2007-09 recession, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The president will also propose increases in funding for the U.S. military, infrastructure and border security.

Congressional officials, along with current and former U.S. officials, said a concern is that eliminating the military-grant program would cause countries to look to U.S. rivals, such as Russia and China. The internal State Department memo outlines what officials see as the likely effects of cuts.

"Without such assistance, partners will likely either not develop/sustain those capabilities, or may turn to other countries (e.g., Russia, China) to assist them in developing them," the memo says.

The internal memo says most countries offered loans are unlikely to take them.

"Converting FMF grants to a loan support mechanism will not assist the vast majority of countries that receive this support, since they would not desire to take out, or would not qualify for an international loan," the memo says.

Officials with the White House's Office of Management and Budget didn't respond to questions about the cuts, and have deferred comment until the full budget is released. Officials from most potentially affected countries didn't address the comments.

Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., Aizaz Chaudhry, said: "Pakistan believes that our relations with the U.S. are a high priority. The two countries need to further strengthen mutually beneficial economic, trade and investment relations."

Mr. Trump has spoken frequently about what he sees as the need for U.S. partners abroad to pay for more of their own defense needs and for Washington to focus on U.S. priorities. But a congressional aide said the shift from grants to loans was unlikely to "play very well" among lawmakers.

"There's real concerns among authorizers over this," he said. "If you care about U.S. influence with these countries for counterterrorism and national security purposes, this will go a long a way to kill it."

The memo cites Lebanon, which it said "may lack the ammunition and vehicles necessary to maintain operations against ISIS" without the U.S. grant program.

Cameroon, Chad and Niger, "may be unable to maintain their airlift, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and protected mobility capabilities necessary to defeat Boko Haram," the memo says.

The cuts could affect Ukraine's ability to deploy countermortar radars in its struggle with pro-Russia separatists backed by Moscow, the memo says.

Andrew Shapiro, a former Obama administration official who headed the State Department's bureau of Political Military Affairs, said the grant program benefits U.S. diplomats and U.S. companies.

"The program helped ambassadors, defense attaches and visiting officials develop relationships," he said.

Cameroon, Chad and Niger, "may be unable to maintain their airlift, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and protected mobility capabilities necessary to defeat Boko Haram," the memo says.

For Pakistan, its "maritime forces may have a reduced ability to patrol the maritime border," the memo says. "Pakistan's ability to continue participating in USNAVCENT-led maritime coalitions will come into doubt, as the Pakistan Navy is in the process of decommissioning its British-class frigates and needs additional surface vessels."

The cuts could affect Ukraine's ability to deploy countermortar radars, an important issue in its struggle with pro-Russia separatists backed by Moscow, the memo says.

In Colombia, where the U.S. is supporting efforts to move beyond a 50-year civil war, the cuts could affect the country's ability to maintain its helicopter fleet, needed to fight organized crime in remote areas, the memo says.

Andrew Shapiro, a former Obama administration official who headed the State Department's bureau of Political Military Affairs, said the grant program benefits U.S. diplomats and U.S. companies.

"The program helped ambassadors, defense attaches and visiting officials develop relationships," he said. "This could also hurt U.S. companies who could sell these products. Countries will now look elsewhere because our stuff is more expensive than anyone else's. It's the best but you pay for the best."

Trump Budget Would Convert Many Overseas Military Grants to Loans; Lawmakers worry plan would strain some critical relationships

The grants have allowed countries to buy U.S. equipment such as ammunition, vehicles, protective equipment and naval vessels.             

Mr. Trump's administration is set to release his full budget proposal on Tuesday. The administration is considering cuts of up to 31% to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, The Journal has reported.             

Congressional officials, along with current and former U.S. officials, said a key concern is that eliminating the military-grant program would cause countries to look to U.S. rivals, such as Russia and China. The internal State Department memo outlines what officials see as the likely effects of cuts.             

"Without such assistance, partners will likely either not develop/sustain those capabilities, or may turn to other countries (e.g., Russia, China) to assist them in developing them," the memo says.             

The internal memo says most countries offered loans are unlikely to take them.             

"Converting FMF grants to a loan support mechanism will not assist the vast majority of countries that receive this support, since they would not desire to take out, or would not qualify for an international loan," the memo says.                          

Officials with the White House's Office of Management and Budget didn't respond to questions about the cuts, and have deferred comment until the full budget is released. Officials from most potentially affected countries didn't address the comments.             

Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S., Aizaz Chaudhry, said: "Pakistan believes that our relations with the U.S. are a high priority. The two countries need to further strengthen mutually beneficial economic, trade and investment relations."             

Mr. Trump has spoken frequently about what he sees as the need for U.S. partners abroad to pay for more of their own defense needs and for Washington to focus on U.S. priorities. But a congressional aide said the shift from grants to loans was unlikely to "play very well" among lawmakers.                          

"There's real concerns among authorizers over this," he said. "If you care about U.S. influence with these countries for counterterrorism and national security purposes, this will go a long a way to kill it."             

The memo cites Lebanon, which it said "may lack the ammunition and vehicles necessary to maintain operations against ISIS" without the U.S. grant program.             

Cameroon, Chad and Niger, "may be unable to maintain their airlift, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and protected mobility capabilities necessary to defeat Boko Haram," the memo says.             

For Pakistan, its "maritime forces may have a reduced ability to patrol the maritime border," the memo says. "Pakistan's ability to continue participating in USNAVCENT-led maritime coalitions will come into doubt, as the Pakistan Navy is in the process of decommissioning its British-class frigates and needs additional surface vessels."             

The cuts could affect Ukraine's ability to deploy countermortar radars, an important issue in its struggle with pro-Russia separatists backed by Moscow, the memo says.             

In Colombia, where the U.S. is supporting efforts to move beyond a 50-year civil war, the cuts could affect the country's ability to maintain its helicopter fleet, needed to fight organized crime in remote areas, the memo says.             

Andrew Shapiro, a former Obama administration official who headed the State Department's bureau of Political Military Affairs, said the grant program benefits U.S. diplomats and U.S. companies.             

"The program helped ambassadors, defense attaché and visiting officials develop relationships," he said. "This could also hurt U.S. companies who could sell these products. Countries will now look elsewhere because our stuff is more expensive than anyone else's. It's the best but you pay for the best."

Trump Feels 'Hamstrung' in Ability to Work With Moscow, Adviser Says; McMaster says president told Russians he wants to move beyond "all of the Russia news" to address issues such as the fight against  ISIS

WASHINGTON—resident Donald Trump is limited in his ability to cooperate with Moscow because of investigations of possible connections between Russia and his 2016 campaign, a top adviser said.

Mr. Trump wants to confront Russia over its actions in Ukraine and Syria and cooperate with the country to fight against Islamic State, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday morning on ABC.

Mr. Trump met with Russian diplomats in the White House not long after dismissing James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was probing Russian interactions with the president's campaign officials. The New York Times reported Friday that Mr. Trump had told Russian officials during the meeting that his firing of Mr. Comey had relieved pressure on him related to Russia.

Mr. McMaster said Sunday the Oval Office meeting was an opportunity for the leaders to discuss challenges in the two countries' working relationship.

"The gist of the conversation was that the president feels as if he is hamstrung in his ability to work with Russia to find areas of cooperation because this has been obviously so much in the news," Mr. McMaster said. "The intent of that conversation was to say what I'd like to do is move beyond all of the Russia news so that we can find areas of cooperation."

Democrats and other political critics have attacked Mr. Trump for continuing to seek close engagement in Moscow as officials are investigating Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.

"We need to be clear that we don't have aligned interests with Russia," Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) said on ABC.

Mr. Trump has denied any campaign collaboration with Moscow and dismissed reports as "fake news."

"What the president was trying to convey to the Russians is, look, I'm not going to be distracted by this, all these issues that are here at home," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Fox News. Mr. Trump doesn't want to "distract from our efforts to see if we can engage with you, engage with Russia, and identify areas where we might be able to work together," he said.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who ran against Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primaries, said he would wait for conclusions of the intelligence committee he serves on before weighing in on reports about the Russian diplomatic conversations and Mr. Comey. "I do not want to undermine the credibility of this effort in one direction or another," Mr. Rubio said Sunday on CNN.

Still, if the president were attempting to interfere with FBI and impede then investigation then it would be "potential obstruction of justice that people have to make a decision on," Mr. Rubio said.

World News: Syria Officials Dispute Account by U.S. of Attack

The Syrian regime and its militia allies said Friday that their forces were attacked by the U.S.-led coalition while they were fighting Islamic State, an assertion the U.S. dismissed as false.

The coalition on Thursday launched a rare airstrike against pro-regime forces to halt their advance toward U.S.-backed rebels operating along the border with Jordan in southeastern Syria. The elite rebel force based in al-Tanf, Maghaweer al-Thawra, is planning to advance northward to take territory along the Syrian-Iraqi border and divide land under Islamic State control, rebels in the group said.

But rebels said the pro-regime forces were trying to cut the rebels off and insert themselves into the battle against Islamic State, aiming to shore up longstanding claims by the Syrian government that it is leading the fight against terrorism in the six-year-old conflict.

"This is all part of the scramble for eastern Syria that has been sparked by the imminent collapse or defeat of ISIS," said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. "This is the first time that America has intentionally attacked Syrian forces in a contest for control of Syrian land."

While proving that it is fighting terrorism is part of the regime's calculations in its battlefield movements, Mr. Landis said it is really about control of Syria.

"Syria has to be worried about America setting up a proxy rebel force to control this area," he said.

The Syrian government condemned the U.S. attack and said it was fighting terrorism, adding no one has the right to dictate how the regime should fight "terrorist organizations" such as Islamic State and al Qaeda. Though the regime insists it is fighting terrorism, it has focused most of its airstrikes and artillery attacks on antigovernment rebels over the years.

In Washington, the Pentagon said Friday that the regime-led troops it targeted Thursday weren't near Islamic State forces and that the U.S. action was required for defensive purposes.

The Trump administration has shown more willingness to use force against Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

The Pentagon took strikes on one of Mr. Assad's air bases in April in response to a chemical-weapons attack U.S. officials attributed to the regime.

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Friday this week's actions were self-defense strikes that the coalition troops took to protect themselves.

He also cited changes to the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State approved by President Donald Trump, saying the U.S. military has assumed more authority from the White House and has refined its tactical approach.

Mr. Mattis said the president had given U.S. military commanders more leeway to make battlefield decisions themselves and approved a tactical shift that directs U.S.-backed troops to focus on annihilating Islamic State rather than waging a war of attrition.

"No longer will we have slowed decision cycles because Washington, D.C., has to authorize tactical movements on the ground," Mr. Mattis said at a news conference, where he appeared alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joe Dunford and the State Department's special envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition, Brett McGurk.

Mr. Mattis said U.S.-backed troops previously were surrounding Islamic State positions and allowing enemy fighters to escape through a designated exit route, because the goal was to oust them from occupied cities as quickly as possible and allow residents to return. But the effect, the defense secretary said, was essentially to move the Islamic State fighters around the area.

Mr. McGurk cited the recent capture of the Tabqa Dam in Syria by a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters as an example of the new battlefield leeway leading to quicker execution.

Mr. McGurk said some 55,500 square kilometers of territory had been liberated and 4.1 million people freed from Islamic State control since the campaign began in mid-2014.

World News: German Court Sentences Syrian for  ISIS  Link

BERLIN -- A Berlin court sentenced a 20-year-old Syrian to five years in juvenile detention for being a member of Islamic State, in a trial billed as a test of Germany's capacity to weed out radicals from among the many refugees who have arrived in the past two years.

In their ruling Friday, the five judges found Shaas al-Mohammad guilty of being a member of a foreign terrorist group and violating the country's weapons laws.

The charges encompassed acts committed outside Germany, including serving as an armed guard in Islamic State's siege of the city of Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria, and offering himself as a contact person for the militant group to carry out future attacks in Europe.

He was also found guilty of passing on information, such as visitor numbers to popular tourist spots in Berlin, to a Syrian contact for possible use in targeting attacks.

"We came to the certain conviction that he was a member of IS and did not cut ties with IS despite fleeing to Germany," said the presiding judge, Andreas Muller.

A defense lawyer, Tarig Elobied, said he would appeal the verdict before Germany's Federal Court of Justice. Mr. Elobied had argued that the defendant never was a member of Islamic State but rather of a different group fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The accused didn't testify at the trial.

The case was the first trial of a recently arrived refugee accused of colluding with terrorists since a surge in the number of asylum seekers, mostly from the Middle East and other Muslim countries.

Radicalized asylum seekers have committed several attacks since Mr. al-Mohammad was arrested in March 2016, and dozens have been arrested or charged. But security officials have been concerned that cases could be hard to prosecute given the high standard of proof required by Germany's criminal-justice system.

Syria, Russia Criticize U.S.-Led Strikes Near Jordanian Border; Pentagon defends Thursday airstrike as necessary defensive action

The Syrian regime and its militia allies claimed Friday that their forces were attacked by the U.S.-led coalition while they were fighting Islamic State, an assertion the U.S. dismissed as false.

The coalition on Thursday launched a rare airstrike against pro-regime forces to halt their advance toward U.S.-backed rebels operating along the border with Jordan in southeastern Syria. The elite rebel force based in al-Tanf, Maghaweer al-Thawra, is planning to advance northward to take territory along the Syrian-Iraqi border and divide land under Islamic State control, rebels in the group said.

The Syrian government condemned the U.S. attack and said it was fighting terrorism, adding no one has the right to dictate how the regime should fight "terrorist organizations" such as Islamic State and al Qaeda. Though the regime insists it is fighting terrorism, it has focused most of its airstrikes and artillery attacks on antigovernment rebels over the years.

The regime is supported on the battlefield by an array of Shiite militia fighters from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon. An Iraqi Shiite militia allied with the regime, Sayd al-Shuhada, said Friday that one of its fighters was killed and others were injured in the coalition airstrike "while we were chasing the remnants of ISIS from hill to hill and from valley to valley."

In Washington, the Pentagon said Friday that the regime-led troops it targeted Thursday weren't near Islamic State forces and that the U.S. action was required for defensive purposes.

"The advancing pro-regime forces were preparing fighting positions for several T-72 tanks and artillery," said a statement from the U.S.-led coalition Friday. "The completion of these fighting positions within the established de-confliction zone northwest of al-Tanf would pose a threat to coalition and partner forces at al-Tanf."

Asked about reports that the pro-regime troops had been fighting Islamic State, the Pentagon said the assertion was untrue.

"There are no ISIS near al-Tanf," the statement said.

The U.S.-led coalition also said Friday that it didn't target Assad regime forces. Other U.S. officials and observers on the ground have said the airstrike targeted equipment such as tanks operated by regime forces.

"We believe they were pro-regime forces, not Syrian regime forces," the coalition said in a separate statement.

U.S. officials said they had been monitoring the regime and loyalist forces gradually advance toward the base in Tanf over the past week, especially in the wake of a May 9 Syrian airstrike on rebel positions near the Jordanian border and some 20 miles from where the airstrike hit on Thursday. Russia attempted to dissuade the advance of the pro-regime forces, but failed in the effort, according to the Pentagon.

Russian officials also condemned the coalition airstrike and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he wasn't aware of any warnings from the U.S. ahead of time. He said a few dozen civilians died as a result of the strike.

This isn't the first time the regime has tried to insert itself into an existing battle being waged by the myriad anti-Islamic State forces operating inside Syria.

In February, Turkish-backed rebels known as the Euphrates Shield advanced on the Islamic State-held northern city of al-Bab. At the same time, regime forces moved on the city from the south in an apparent attempt to take it first.

Now that the battle against Islamic State has shifted its focus to the city of Raqqa, regime forces are gradually approaching that area.

In a March interview with a Chinese TV channel, of President Bashar al-Assad said capturing the Islamic State's self-declared capital Raqqa was a priority for his government, even as a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led force is advancing toward the city.

"Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation or consultation or permission, they are invaders, whether they are American, Turkish, or any other one," Mr. Assad said.

U.S. Fight Against Islamic State Is Accelerating, Mattis Says; Defense secretary says recent changes allow faster decisions on battle tactics

WASHINGTON—efense Secretary Jim Mattis said changes in the fight against Islamic State that were approved by President Donald Trump have given the U.S. the ability to move more quickly and forcefully on the battlefield, though the overall strategy remains largely unchanged from the Obama era.

Mr. Mattis said the president had given U.S. military commanders more leeway to make battlefield decisions and approved a tactical shift that directs U.S.-backed troops to focus on annihilating Islamic State rather than waging a war of attrition.

"No longer will we have slowed decision cycles because Washington, D.C., has to authorize tactical movements on the ground," Mr. Mattis said at a Pentagon news conference, where he appeared alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joe Dunford and the State Department's special envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition, Brett McGurk.

Mr. Mattis said U.S.-backed troops previously were surrounding Islamic State positions and allowing enemy fighters to escape through a designated exit route, because the goal was to oust them from occupied cities as quickly as possible and allow residents to return.

But the effect, the defense secretary said, was essentially to move Islamic State fighters around the area.

"We carry out the annihilation campaign so we don't simply transplant this problem from one location to another," Mr. Mattis said.

Mr. McGurk cited the recent capture of the Tabqa dam in Syria by a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters as an example of the new battlefield leeway leading to quicker execution.

"Military people on the ground saw an opportunity to surprise ISIS," he said. "That happened very fast."

Apart from the modifications described by Mr. Mattis, the strategy to dislodge Islamic State from Iraq and Syria largely appears to be the same as under the Obama administration, despite Mr. Trump's criticism of the approach during last year's presidential campaign.

Gen. Dunford and Mr. McGurk, who both held their positions during the Obama administration, helped execute the original strategy.

All three of the top U.S. officials emphasized the progress of the campaign since it began in mid-2014. Mr. McGurk said some 55,00 square kilometers (21,000 square miles) had been liberated and 4.1 million people freed from Islamic State control.

The Trump administration has shown more willingness to use force against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The Pentagon took strikes on one of Mr. Assad's air bases in April in response to a chemical weapons attack U.S. officials attributed to the regime.

On Thursday, the U.S.-led coalition in Syria launched airstrikes on regime-allied forces in al-Tanf, on the border with Jordan, as they approached U.S.-backed rebels in the area. Mr. Mattis said Friday those were self-defense strikes that the coalition troops took to protect themselves.

"It was necessitated by offensive movement with offensive capability of what we believe were Iranian-directed forces…nside an established and agreed upon deconfliction zone," Mr. Mattis said.

He said the forces moved into the deconfliction zone "apparently against the advice of the Russians."

Unlike in Iraq, where the U.S. is working with its government to eliminate Islamic State, the U.S. must take on the extremist group in Syria while trying to avoid clashes with the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers.

Gen. Dunford said the U.S. military is precluded by law from coordinating with the Russians but engages in "deconfliction" to avoid unnecessary clashes that endanger American troops.

"My sense is that the Russians are as enthusiastic as we are to deconflict operations and ensure that we can continue to take the campaign to ISIS and ensure the safety of our personnel," Gen. Dunford said.

Trump Goes to Saudi Arabia

By Karen Elliott House

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia -- President Trump will receive an effusive welcome here from his royal hosts determined to underscore that once again Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are close allies. Barack Obama favored Iran, but that's over. King Salman, 81, is gathering 50 Islamic leaders to meet Mr. Trump. This unprecedented assembly is intended to show not only that Saudi Arabia is the leader of the Islamic world but that Muslim leaders support the U.S. against Islamic State terrorists.

While the elderly monarch is host, the indisputable power behind the throne is his young son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, 31. He is orchestrating a two-day summit spectacular that will star Donald Trump and the new face of Saudi Arabia -- a country now enjoying once-forbidden entertainment and a much larger role for women, who may be allowed to drive as early as this summer. Conservatives seethe but can't block change.

The young prince and the president have much in common. Both are outsiders, brash, unorthodox and new to politics. Each faces strong opposition at home. Both seek to spur economic growth by reducing the role of government. And each is fighting orthodoxy: MBS, as the prince is known, wants to curb the role of religion and tradition, which inhibit modernization, while Mr. Trump battles leftist orthodoxy and political correctness. Both are smart marketers.

Mr. Trump's presence is an opportunity for the prince to show off his modernization effort. An extravaganza featuring something for everyone -- the Harlem Globetrotters taking on a Saudi basketball team, car races, country singer Toby Keith -- is intended to convince Americans there is a new, open Saudi Arabia and Saudis that mixing cultures and sexes isn't evil.

How can the son of a king be an outsider? In a culture that reveres age, especially among the royal family's thousands of princes, the appointment last year of a young man who isn't a senior prince, nor even his father's eldest son, came as a shock. Like Mr. Trump, Mohammed bin Salman faces a "resistance" in the form of determined opponents among his royal relatives. Social media has created a "virtual opposition" by enabling disgruntled citizens to express their views.

So both the prince and the president seek success to bolster their leadership, easier to achieve in diplomacy than domestic affairs. Given the badly frayed state of U.S.-Saudi relations, Mr. Trump is guaranteed a win, at least with Saudis, because he isn't Barack Obama. The president has further pleased Riyadh by making this his first stop on his first foreign trip. No president has ever put Saudi Arabia first so visibly.

But the Saudis want concrete support once Air Force One lifts off for Israel, Rome and then a NATO summit in Brussels. Both countries see Iran as a threat, but the U.S. president demands more burden-sharing from allies. So the prince, who also is defense minister, is said to be ready to invite the U.S. military back to Saudi bases vacated in 2003 in the face of opposition to foreign troops in the land of the two holy mosques. Riyadh is fighting a costly war against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the prince wants more U.S. support.

If the leaders agree to return the U.S. military here, it would mark a significant new commitment to Saudi Arabia's defense -- and surely be seen by Iran as a provocation. It would be a clear triumph for both leaders -- and a repudiation of Mr. Obama's exhortation that Saudi Arabia "share the neighborhood" with Iran.

The U.S. wants to curb Iranian expansion but may be cautious about new entanglements as Saudi-Iranian tensions are rising. Prince Mohammad recently slammed the door on any dialogue with Iran, insisting that Tehran seeks domination of the Muslim world. "We know we are a major target," he said. "We will not wait until the battle is in Saudi Arabia, but we will work so the battle is there." Iran immediately warned that if Riyadh persisted with "such stupidity," nothing will be "left in Saudi Arabia except Mecca and Medina."

Beyond bases and Islamic nation support in the fight against ISIS terrorists, King Salman seeks to tie the House of Saud to the Trump family. The king has just named another of his sons, Khalid, 29, a former fighter pilot, as ambassador to the U.S. Sending his son to Washington is a very personal gesture to a president with family working in the White House.

Prince Mohammad faces much tougher domestic challenges than President Trump does. The prince has to transform an economy and society long addicted to oil revenues, which have collapsed, and persuade coddled Saudis they must work. Mr. Trump is trying to raise U.S. GDP growth to 3% from 1%; Saudi Arabia has no growth. Mr. Trump seeks to spur U.S. energy production, while the prince is suppressing Saudi production to stabilize prices, in part weakened by growth in U.S. oil production. The U.S. got good news that unemployment is down to 4.4%. Saudi unemployment officially is 11%, but among the 70% of Saudis under 30 the true figure is triple that.

Mr. Trump, for all the angry opposition at home, is more secure than the deputy crown prince. Should his father die, a new king may remove Mohammad bin Salman. Some Saudis believe King Salman will promote MBS to crown prince and thus next in line to be king -- but he hasn't yet done so.

Regardless of these uncertainties, Mohammed bin Salman is confidently pushing ahead with ambitious plans to transform Saudi Arabia. Like Mr. Trump, the prince needs some clear wins over the next several years -- an end to the costly Yemen war; successful privatization of Aramco, the national oil company, and other government companies set for public sale. He must persuade skeptical citizens that his plans will in coming years provide Saudis a prosperous life without dependence on oil.

Egypt and Saudi Arabia Come Together Ahead of Trump Trip; The two Arab powerhouses put aside differences in advance of U.S. president's visit to Riyadh

CAIRO—n private, Egyptian officials like to complain about arrogant and uncouth Saudis. In Riyadh, there is just as much eye-rolling about the supposedly unreliable and incompetent Egyptians.

Periodically, this tension erupts into open spats. Yet these quarrels only go so far: no matter the mutual frustration, the Arab world's most populous country and its economic powerhouse simply can't afford not to get along with each other.

The latest such cycle of squabbles followed by reconciliation began in October, when Egypt—lone among Muslim members of the United Nations Security Council—supported a Russian-sponsored resolution on Syria. That angered Saudi Arabia, which backs Syrian rebels targeted by Russian airstrikes.

Tensions finally subsided in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump courted Cairo and Riyadh. The Trump administration is pushing for a new coalition of moderate Arab states hostile to Iran and open to cooperation with Israel that would be anchored on an alliance between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Mr. Trump is kicking off his first foreign trip as president with this weekend's summit of Arab and Muslim nations convened by King Salman in Riyadh that will also be attended by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.

Just a few months ago, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were barely on speaking terms. Saudi Arabia threw a financial lifeline to Mr. Sisi after he overthrew President Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. Egypt, however, didn't share Saudi hostility to the Syrian regime and provided only lukewarm support for Saudi Arabia's war against pro-Iranian militias in Yemen. After the U.N. vote, Riyadh indicated its displeasure by withholding subsidized fuel supplies from Egypt.

Then, in January—mid escalating rhetoric—an Egyptian court blocked a deal under which Mr. Sisi had agreed to transfer two uninhabited Red Sea islands to Saudi control. Saudi officials doubted that the court would have made such a move without Mr. Sisi's tacit approval, and relations continued to deteriorate until the Egyptian leader and King Salman finally agreed to disagree at an Arab League summit in Jordan in March. Fuel supplies have been restored and Mr. Sisi was welcomed with honors last month in Riyadh.

At a time when Syria, Libya, Yemen and Iraq are consumed by wars, a feud between Cairo and Riyadh was a luxury that neither country could permit, said Nabil Fahmy, who served as Mr. Sisi's foreign minister in 2013-14.

"There will be points of agreement and points of disagreement but we need to manage them on both sides," said Mr. Fahmy, currently a professor at the American University in Cairo. "There is a threat of a breakup of the entire Arab nation-state system and that would have tremendous consequences. That's a much larger threat than a difference of opinion on islands."

Mr. Sisi agreed a year ago that the two islands—iran and Sanafir, at the mouth of the Straits of Tiran that guard maritime access to Israel's and Jordan's Red Sea ports—elong to Saudi Arabia. Under a 1950 deal between the two countries, Saudi Arabia allowed Egypt, then a much mightier military power, to take control of the islands as part of the confrontation with Israel.

That fact, however, was little known in Egypt—nd the surprise decision to transfer the islands sparked rare street protests against Mr. Sisi.

"I don't care whether the islands belong to Egypt or Saudi Arabia, but the way they presented this is wrong. People were shocked. Historically, Egyptians believed this is our land," said former lawmaker Anwar E. Sadat, a nephew of Egypt's late president and a critic of the government.

These protests were fueled by a sense—hared by many Egyptians—hat Egypt, once the Arab world's undisputed leader, has lost that mantle to Saudi Arabia's benefit. While the islands deal is still making its way through the courts and Egypt's parliament, officials in Cairo suggest the actual handover won't happen anytime soon because Mr. Sisi, amid Egypt's economic crisis, is loath to spark renewed protests.

In Riyadh, that is a detail that officials prefer not to notice in public. In a rare TV interview this month on the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya channel, the kingdom's powerful Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he had no doubt that the island issue will be resolved in time for one of the kingdom's major infrastructure projects—he King Salman Bridge that would link Egypt and Saudi Arabia via the disputed islands—o be started by 2020.

It is only Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood that are trying to provoke a quarrel between Cairo and Riyadh, he added. "Relations with deep roots do not get affected in any way whatsoever," Prince Mohammed said. "In the history between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the two countries have always stood with each other during all circumstances and during all times and this has not changed."

To what extent that will be the case in coming months remains to be seen, as long as the main areas of disagreement—articularly the islands and Saudi requests for a greater Egyptian role in the Yemen war—emain unresolved, cautioned Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a moderate Islamist politician who ran for president in Egypt's 2012 elections.

"The reasons behind the dispute still stand," he said, "and so this rapprochement is not built on strong bases."

NATO Mulls Arctic and Atlantic Command to Counter Russia; Officials are discussing reviving a Cold War-era command to monitor increased Russian submarine activity

BRUSSELS—he North Atlantic Treaty Organization may revive a Cold War naval command to counter Moscow's increased submarine activity in the Arctic and protect Atlantic sea lanes in the event of a conflict, according to allied diplomats and officials briefed on the planning work.

Discussions about bringing back NATO's old Atlantic Command indicate that the alliance remains focused on improving allied defenses against a resurgent Russia despite the Trump administration's demand for a greater focus on counterterrorism.

Top military officers from NATO nations, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, gathered in Brussels this week received a briefing on a review of the command structure, including options for the Atlantic post.

Military planners and defense experts warn that Russia's submarine fleet is increasingly able to operate in the Arctic and North Atlantic without detection, as NATO's ability to monitor its activities have declined since the Cold War.

Developing strategies to protect Atlantic sea lanes has risen in importance amid an alliance resurrection of Cold War plans for moving heavy military equipment rapidly from the U.S. to Europe in case of a confrontation with Russia.

If that were to happen, military planners and defense experts believe Russia's submarine fleet could complicate protecting U.S. convoys.

Researchers from the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank, recently briefed NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on military challenges in the Arctic and Atlantic. They laid out results of wargame simulation in which Russian subs interrupt an alliance military exercise, attack a U.S. military transport ship, and cut an undersea cable between Iceland and Canada, interrupting global communications.

An allied command focused on those issues, said NATO officials briefed on the review, could help create war plans to overcome challenges and prod allies to make crucial investments in surveillance planes, ships and other military hardware.

Czech Army Gen. Petr Pavel, the chairman of NATO's military committee who is leading the review, said new challenges, like Russia's use of so-called hybrid or nontraditional military tactics, as well as separate rising terrorism threats, necessitate the review. He declined to discuss details.

"We have to assess potential threats from any direction, including the North Atlantic, including the Arctic," Gen. Pavel said.

From 1952 to 2003, NATO had a Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, usually an admiral, headquartered in Norfolk, Va., who focused on plans to ship war materiel from the U.S. to Europe.

NATO aims to complete its command structure review by February 2018. But before then, alliance diplomats must hash out delicate political questions about what NATO member would lead the command, the precise responsibilities and where it would be located.

The deployment of a new 4,500 strong NATO force to the Baltic Sea region has increased the need to ensure the allies have the freedom to use the Atlantic Ocean to reinforce the forward-positioned troops, according to an alliance official.

The U.S. has allocated money to modernize Iceland's Keflavik Air Station. But Jerry Hendrix, a defense fellow at CNAS, said more allied resources including patrol boats, submarines and additional aircraft are needed for the Atlantic and Arctic.

If Russian subs can slip past Iceland undetected, they are able to hide easily and threaten U.S. reinforcements of European allies. Currently, in the event of a conflict with Moscow, allies would likely have to choose between escorting convoys carrying supplies to Europe or hunting Russian subs, said Mr. Hendrix, a retired Naval officer. If the U.S. can't move equipment to Europe, he said, the alliance will be weakened.

"It's important to patrol those waters," Mr. Hendrix said. "Once they get past Iceland it is like finding a needle in a haystack. Investments we make there are critical to guaranteeing victory in any future conflict."

NAFTA

Currency Rules Are

Under Consideration

The Trump administration has told senators it is considering adding rules barring currency manipulation to the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to congressional aides, a departure from past policy that could set a precedent for other trade deals.

The aides said Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told senators Wednesday that he is looking at currency rules as a part of planned renegotiation of Nafta, the 23-year-old trade pact that connects the U.S., Canadian and Mexican economies.

An administration official confirmed the U.S. is looking at some sort of currency disciplines but didn't say whether the rules would be binding and enforceable through Nafta's dispute-settlement procedures.

Mr. Lighthizer is briefing key House and Senate lawmakers this week on the agreement, and the Trump administration is expected in coming days to send Congress a letter announcing plans for formal Nafta negotiations. The talks, which could start in three months, would likely include Nafta updates to address technology and the internet, as well as stronger rules on which products qualify for duty-free trade in order to favor North American supply chains.

Canada and Mexico haven't been the focus of U.S. criticism over currency, but adding currency rules to Nafta could set a precedent for including them in future negotiations with Asian trading partners.

HOMELAND SECURITY

Wisconsin Sheriff

To Join Department

Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump and a familiar face in conservative media, said he accepted an appointment as assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

In an interview with conservative WISN radio host Vicki McKenna, Sheriff Clarke said he would be leaving his position in June to join the Office of Partnership and Engagement, where he will be the chief liaison between the agency and state, local and tribal law enforcement.

In an email, a spokeswoman for the department said the position is typically announced only when made official. "No such announcement with regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made," she said. The position doesn't need Senate confirmation. Sheriff Clarke didn't respond to requests to comment.

A prolific user of social media and a regular presence on conservative talk shows, Sheriff Clarke has repeatedly stirred controversy. In a 2015 tweet, the African-American sheriff said Black Lives Matter protesters would "join forces with ISIS" to bring down the country. He also has said mass incarceration of black Americans is a lie, and he has said that undocumented immigrants have more protections than American citizens in sanctuary cities.

SENATE

North Carolina's Tillis

Collapses During Race

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis collapsed while running in a race in Washington on Wednesday but quickly issued a statement saying he was doing well.

About an hour after he collapsed, the first-term Republican senator posted a video message on Twitter in which he said he was "doing well."

"Just got overheated. No CPR, no special measures, just checking me out," Mr. Tillis said. "See you back on the Hill."

Mr. Tillis, 56 years old, was running in a 3-mile race in the capital's Anacostia Park. He was tended to by paramedics and transported to George Washington University Hospital in an ambulance.

Mr. Tillis was elected to the Senate in 2014 after serving as the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives for four years. In the Senate, Mr. Tillis has sought to work with lawmakers in both parties to build support for an overhaul of the immigration system. The senator is married with two children.

World News: Israeli Source Seen as Key to Countering  ISIS  Threat

WASHINGTON -- The classified information that President Donald Trump shared with Russian officials last week came from an Israeli source described by multiple U.S. officials as the most valuable source of information on external plotting by Islamic State.

These officials, who are privy to intelligence about the terrorist group's efforts, said the source of information was particularly valuable for tracking Islamic State's attempts to place explosive devices on commercial airplanes.

However, the officials disagree over how much damage Mr. Trump may have caused to counterterrorism efforts by discussing information gleaned from Israel with the Russians during an Oval Office meeting last week.

One official said that now that the Russians are aware of the source, there is greater risk that the source could be compromised in some way. That makes it less likely that U.S. officials will trust the information, the official said.

But others disagreed on how much damage Mr. Trump may have caused to counterterrorism efforts by discussing information gathered by Israel. Another official doubted that the Russians would be able to identify the nature of the source based on Mr. Trump's statements, though Moscow might learn more about where in Syria the intelligence was coming from.

While not the only source of information on the threat to airlines, it was considered the most important, the officials said. Based on cumulative intelligence, the U.S. has barred carry-on laptop computers and other consumer electronic equipment from 10 airports in the Middle East and is considering expanding the ban.

To avoid further damage, the U.S. officials declined to specify whether the source of information is an individual or part of a technological system. But their unanimous agreement on the importance of the source to one of Washington's top national security objectives -- countering international plots by Islamic State -- underscores the gravity of the Oval Office conversation and the potential repercussions for Mr. Trump of sharing information that was supposed to be restricted to the U.S. and Israel.

The difficulty in assessing the fallout from Mr. Trump's decision to share the information is likely to be a subject of debate within the intelligence community. A third official said it could take some time to know if the source had been so compromised that it's no longer useful.

All the officials agreed that the president's impromptu revelation had shaken career intelligence officers' confidence in Mr. Trump's ability to keep secrets and exacerbated long-standing tensions between him and the intelligence community.

Publicly, Israeli officials have played down the significance of Mr. Trump's conversation with the Russian visitors, Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, and Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

But privately, Israeli intelligence officials are fuming, one of the U.S. officials said, having worried for months that Mr. Trump would expose state secrets, even unwittingly, because of his lack of experience in handling classified information and his propensity to shoot from the hip.

Mr. Trump's top aides have defended his actions, and some U.S. officials consider the ensuing news coverage an overreaction. The U.S.-Israeli relationship, they say, will remain intact because it is mutually beneficial.

'What About the Refugees?' The U.S. Is Doing More Than Anyone

By Nikki Haley

I was onstage at the end of a very long day when the heckling started.

I was telling an international women's conference about how, earlier that day, I had stood up in the United Nations Security Council to condemn Syria for a chemical-weapons attack that had put dead children on the front pages of the world's newspapers. I was about to get to the part about how the U.S. would act to stop future chemical attacks when someone in the audience shouted: "What about the refugees?"

The heckling was rude, but the question was legitimate. The Syrian war has created one of the greatest refugee crises of our time, with 12 million Syrian men, women and children -- half the prewar population -- killed or forced to flee their homes. What is happening in Syria and its neighboring countries is a true humanitarian crisis. But those who accuse the U.S. of heartlessness in the face of this crisis are wrong.

No country has invested more in protecting, housing, feeding and caring for Syrian refugees than the U.S. We have provided nearly $6.5 billion in emergency assistance for Syria since the start of the crisis. Inside Syria, some four million people benefit from U.S. assistance for essentials like food and shelter every month.

In the coming days, I will travel to two neighboring countries that have performed an admirable service in taking in Syrian refugees: Jordan and Turkey. The purpose of my visit is to see firsthand what news reports and official briefings can't fully convey: how refugees are coping, day in and day out. I will talk to government leaders about how U.S. programs are working to help both those displaced by the violence in Syria and the communities that host them.

Turkey today is host to almost three million Syrian refugees, while Jordan feeds, houses and educates some 659,000 refugees, more than half of whom are children.

In both countries, I will go to refugee camps, some of which are large cities with schools, shops, water systems and medical facilities. Couples are wed in these camps, babies are born, and entrepreneurs start businesses. I will visit with refugee families participating in an innovative U.S.-funded food program in which families are given electronic cards to shop at stores in the camps. This program allows refugees the dignity of being able to purchase and cook the food of their choosing rather than donated foodstuffs.

I will also see firsthand U.N. efforts to ship humanitarian assistance from Jordan and Turkey, despite obstacles erected by the Syrian regime. The dictator Bashar Assad attempts to control who does -- and who does not -- receive humanitarian assistance in Syria. His ruthless regime continues to hold entire towns and villages hostage, denying aid to the people inside.

But in 2014 the U.N. Security Council authorized the U.N. and its implementing partners to use four border crossings to ship food, medicine and other lifesaving assistance into and around Syria. Through these cross-border aid programs, the U.N. and its partners have delivered more than 13,600 trucks full of humanitarian supplies to desperate civilian populations otherwise unreachable through aid programs that originate inside Syria. As a result of these programs and U.S. funding for them, millions of Syrians have been helped.

Another humanitarian aid operation I will observe is a U.N. World Food Program project that conducts high-altitude airdrops of emergency food and other aid to Syrians in an area under siege by ISIS. With the support of the U.S., this program has successfully conducted more than 230 drops since it began last year.

In addition, I will visit U.S.-funded schools that are educating both Syrian refugee and local children. Jordanian schools have been so overwhelmed by Syrian children that they have had to institute double shifts. I will meet with Syrian students who attend their school in the afternoon, after Jordanian students attend in the morning. In Turkey I will visit a U.S.-funded school built for Syrian children.

With American help, Syria's neighbors have made the difference between life and death for millions of Syrians. The U.S. and the U.N. will continue to do a great deal of heavy lifting for these desperate people.

There won't be a fully adequate response to the question "What about the refugees?" until there is peace in Syria -- when ISIS is defeated and when the Assad regime no longer terrorizes its people. The U.S. is striving toward both of these goals. Until they are realized, we are committed to easing the suffering of Syrian refugees and supporting the countries that host them.

Trump Defends Russia Disclosure --- President says he has 'absolute right' to share information; lawmakers voice serious concerns

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that he had the "absolute right" to share counterterrorism information with Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting, fueling a rapidly escalating controversy over reports that he divulged sensitive intelligence obtained from a U.S. ally.

"I have the absolute right" as president to share "facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter .

The president wrote that he shared the information for "humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism."

The tweets offered little to mollify some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where one leading Senate Republican said the president appeared to be changing the story in a way that was confusing and concerning, and that the allegations were problematic.

The Wall Street Journal reported late Monday that Mr. Trump divulged details about Islamic State to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in his meeting last week in a way that revealed enough information for them potentially to compromise the source of the intelligence, according to officials, who said the intelligence came from the U.S. ally.

The Washington Post had earlier reported Mr. Trump's disclosure and that White House officials called the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency to warn of Mr. Trump's disclosure and its possible consequences.

Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, said Tuesday at a White House briefing that the counterterrorism information that Mr. Trump shared was appropriate.

"What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation," Mr. McMaster said. "It was wholly appropriate to share what the threat was in the context."

Mr. McMaster declined to answer questions on whether Mr. Trump discussed classified information with the Russian officials.

He also said that Mr. Trump "wasn't even aware of where this information came from. He wasn't briefed on the source."

Mr. McMaster said Mr. Trump didn't discuss ISIS-controlled territories that weren't already publicly known.

"It was nothing that you would not know from open-source reporting," Mr. McMaster said. "It had all to do with operations that are already ongoing have been made public for months."

Asked why White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert had reportedly placed calls to the directors of the CIA and NSA after the meeting if Mr. Trump had not disclosed any sensitive intelligence, Mr. McMaster said he hadn't spoken with Mr. Bossert but that the adviser could have done so "out of an overabundance of caution."

He said he and other officials at the meeting, including national security adviser for strategy Dina Powell , didn't feel that the conversation was "inappropriate."

An administration official said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's tweet Tuesday didn't confirm the Post article and that it didn't address the question of whether classified information had been shared by Mr. Trump one way or the other.

According to one U.S. official, the information shared was highly sensitive and difficult to acquire and was considered extraordinarily valuable. The Journal agreed not to identify the ally because another U.S. official said it could jeopardize the source.

The White House didn't provide a detailed statement about Mr. Trump's meeting last week with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergei Kislyak , the Russian ambassador, which was closed to the press. A photographer from the Russian news agency TASS was in the room and published photographs.

Mr. Trump noted on Twitter that the meeting was "openly scheduled." The meeting with Mr. Lavrov was on the president's public schedule, but the schedule didn't state that Mr. Kislyak would also attend.

Later Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that he had asked former FBI Director James Comey , whom he fired last week the day before the meeting with the Russians, and others "to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community....."

Presidents have the legal right to declassify intelligence as they see fit. But doing so can put intelligence sources abroad in danger and make them less willing to work with the U.S., several defense officials said.

The latest disclosures stunned Washington's national-security veterans on both sides of the political divide.

Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) called it "concerning" that "information that reveals classified national security information is shared with the Russians," although he added that there was "conflicting information."

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) said the Trump administration's initial pushback on the reports indicates the White House has a recording of the meeting.

"Clearly if there is some kind of a readout or a transcript from that meeting that means there is a tape," Ms. Klobuchar said. "We need to get a hold of that" in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said in a Bloomberg interview that he hoped to see fewer distractions coming out of the White House.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Loose Lips Sink Presidencies

The state of the Trump Presidency has been perpetual turbulence, which seems to be how the principal likes it. The latest vortex is over Mr. Trump's disclosure of sensitive intel to the Russians -- and whatever the particulars of the incident, the danger is that Presidencies can withstand only so much turbulence before they come apart.

The Washington Post reported Monday night that in an Oval Office meeting last week Mr. Trump relayed high-level "code word" classified material obtained from an ally to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Cue another Washington meltdown. The President took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to defend himself, claiming an "absolute right" to disclose "facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety."

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster put a finer point on it at a Tuesday press conference, though without denying key details. He said Mr. Trump's disclosure was "wholly appropriate" and didn't expose intelligence sources and methods.

Presidents sometimes share secrets with overseas leaders -- even to adversaries such as the Soviets during the Cold War -- if they conclude the benefits of showing what the U.S. knows will aid diplomacy or strategic interests. From media accounts and his tweets, Mr. Trump said something about Islamic State's laptop bomb threat to airlines. He may well have been trying to convince the envoys of the menace ISIS poses to Russian lives and foreign-policy goals, like the Russian airliner that exploded over Sinai in 2015.

Then again, the Post story has Mr. Trump boasting about how great U.S. intelligence is and divulging the info on impulse to prove it. National security officials also asked the reporters to withhold specifics about the item in question, presumably because further disclosure could undermine efforts to counter the threat or endanger the lives of human assets.

Reports emerged on Tuesday that the ally that gathered the material is Israel, and the revelation could endanger this and other intelligence-sharing relationships. The Israelis may hold back if they think their dossiers will be laundered through the U.S. to the Russians and then get passed to their Iranian and Syrian clients, and other foreign services may lose confidence in the U.S.

Lt. Gen. McMaster said he disputed "the premise" of the Post story, which was that Mr. Trump had done something wrong or unbecoming. He confirmed that Mr. Trump made the decision ad hoc "in the context of the conversation," not before the meeting. The problem is that even if the President's conduct was "wholly appropriate," the story's premise is wholly plausible.

The portrait of an inexperienced, impulsive chief who might spill secrets to an overseas foe is one to which Mr. Trump has too often contributed. It was political mismanagement even to hold the Russian meeting, especially the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey amid the investigation of the Trump campaign's alleged Russian connection.

This eruption shows why a President's credibility is so important. If people don't believe Mr. Trump's words or trust his judgment, they won't give him the benefit of the doubt or be responsive if he asks for support. Last week the White House spent two days attributing Mr. Comey's firing to a Justice Department recommendation, only for Mr. Trump to insist in a TV interview that the pink slip came "regardless of recommendation."

News broke late Tuesday of Mr. Comey's contemporaneous notes that Mr. Trump asked him in February to "let this go," referring to the FBI probe of axed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that account of the conversation, but that would be more credible if its previous statements were more reliable.

Mr. Trump's strife and insults with the intelligence community were also bound to invite blowback. The Post report is sourced to "current and former U.S. officials," which raises the question of how former officials are privy to "code word" information, defined as anything that could be expected to cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security if disclosed. In that case the public leaks about Mr. Trump's actions, if true, will do more damage than whatever he said in private.

Mr. Trump is considering a White House shakeup, including cleaning out many of his top aides, but the White House always reflects the President's governing style. If Mr. Trump can't discipline himself, then no Jim Baker ex machina will make much difference.

Mr. Trump needs to appreciate how close he is to losing the Republicans he needs to pass the agenda that will determine if he is successful. Weeks of pointless melodrama and undisciplined comments have depleted public and Capitol Hill attention from health care and tax reform, and exhaustion is setting in. America holds elections every two years, and Mr. Trump's policy allies in Congress will drift away if he looks like a liability.

Millions of Americans recognized Mr. Trump's flaws but decided he was a risk worth taking. They assumed, or at least hoped, that he'd rise to the occasion and the demands of the job. If he cannot, he'll betray their hopes as his Presidency sinks before his eyes.

What is happening in Syria and its neighboring countries is a true humanitarian crisis. But those who accuse the U.S. of heartlessness in the face of this crisis are wrong.

No country has invested more in protecting, housing, feeding and caring for Syrian refugees than the U.S. We have provided nearly $6.5 billion in emergency assistance for Syria since the start of the crisis. Inside Syria, some four million people benefit from U.S. assistance for essentials like food and shelter every month.

In the coming days, I will travel to two neighboring countries that have performed an admirable service in taking in Syrian refugees: Jordan and Turkey. The purpose of my visit is to see firsthand what news reports and official briefings can't fully convey: how refugees are coping, day in and day out. I will talk to government leaders about how U.S. programs are working to help both those displaced by the violence in Syria and the communities that host them.

Turkey today is host to almost three million Syrian refugees, while Jordan feeds, houses and educates some 659,000 refugees, more than half of whom are children.

In both countries, I will go to refugee camps, some of which are large cities with schools, shops, water systems and medical facilities. Couples are wed in these camps, babies are born, and entrepreneurs start businesses. I will visit with refugee families participating in an innovative U.S.-funded food program in which families are given electronic cards to shop at stores in the camps. This program allows refugees the dignity of being able to purchase and cook the food of their choosing rather than donated foodstuffs.

I will also see firsthand U.N. efforts to ship humanitarian assistance from Jordan and Turkey, despite obstacles erected by the Syrian regime. The dictator Bashar Assad attempts to control who does—nd who does not—eceive humanitarian assistance in Syria. His ruthless regime continues to hold entire towns and villages hostage, denying aid to the people inside.

But in 2014 the U.N. Security Councilauthorized the U.N. and its implementing partners to use four border crossings to ship food, medicine and other lifesaving assistance into and around Syria. Through these cross-border aid programs, the U.N. and its partners have delivered more than 13,600 trucks full of humanitarian supplies to desperate civilian populations otherwise unreachable through aid programs that originate inside Syria. As a result of these programs and U.S. funding for them, millions of Syrians have been helped.

Another humanitarian aid operation I will observe is a U.N. World Food Program project that conducts high-altitude airdrops of emergency food and other aid to Syrians in an area under siege by ISIS. With the support of the U.S., this program has successfully conducted more than 230 drops since it began last year.

In addition, I will visit U.S.-funded schools that are educating both Syrian refugee and local children. Jordanian schools have been so overwhelmed by Syrian children that they have had to institute double shifts. I will meet with Syrian students who attend their school in the afternoon, after Jordanian students attend in the morning. In Turkey I will visit a U.S.-funded school built for Syrian children.

With American help, Syria's neighbors have made the difference between life and death for millions of Syrians. The U.S. and the U.N. will continue to do a great deal of heavy lifting for these desperate people.

There won't be a fully adequate response to the question "What about the refugees?" until there is peace in Syria—hen ISIS is defeated and when the Assad regime no longer terrorizes its people. The U.S. is striving toward both of these goals. Until they are realized, we are committed to easing the suffering of Syrian refugees and supporting the countries that host them.

Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke Says He's Joining Homeland Security; The conservative commentator's unconfirmed appointment gets mixed reviews from local law enforcement

Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr., a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump and a familiar face in conservative media, said Wednesday he has accepted a federal appointment as assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The move, unconfirmed by the department, drew a mixed response from law-enforcement officials.

In an interview with conservative WISN radio host Vicki McKenna, Sheriff Clarke said he would be leaving his position in Milwaukee in June to join the Office of Partnership and Engagement, where he will be the chief liaison between state, local and tribal law enforcement and the federal agency.

Sheriff Clarke, in the interview with Ms. McKenna, said he was "honored and humbled" to be appointed to the position.

In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said the position is a secretarial appointment, typically announced only when made official by the secretary.

"No such announcement with regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made," the spokeswoman said.

The position won't need Senate confirmation. Craig Peterson, a spokesman for Sheriff Clarke, said the sheriff is "anxious to serve the president."

A prolific user of social media and a regular presence on conservative talk shows in his trademark cowboy hats, Sheriff Clarke has repeatedly stirred controversy with his views.

He has been a vocal opponent of the largely bipartisan movement for criminal justice reform. In a 2015 tweet, the African-American sheriff said Black Lives Matter protesters will "join forces with ISIS" to bring down the country. He has said that mass incarceration of black Americans is a lie and has claimed that undocumented immigrants have more protections than American citizens in sanctuary cities.

Sheriff Clarke has also clashed with big city police chiefs over policing tactics.

Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents police chiefs from the country's largest cities, said Sheriff Clarke's ideas "don't match exactly with the chiefs in the major cities."

Police chiefs in many major cities have tried in recent years to bridge the gap between law enforcement and minority communities, particularly in the wake of riots in Ferguson, Mo., and have taken steps toward community-based policing.

Sheriff Clarke has championed more aggressive tactics, recently labeling the Obama administration's report on 21st-century policing, which says law-enforcement officers should be guardians rather than warriors, as "flawed." He also supports traffic stops and the practice of stopping and searching people suspected of criminal activity, which has been widely criticized by civil rights groups and was found in New York to be unconstitutional.

Major city chiefs have also bristled at the Trump administration's push to have local police carry out immigration enforcement, saying it takes them away from fighting and preventing violent crime while making immigrants less likely to report crimes. Sheriff Clarke has said his department will continue to work with federal agents to enforce federal immigration laws.

"We'll have just to have to see how to goes," said Mr. Stephens. "Given the past, it'll be a challenge to develop a working relationship."

Sheriffs, who are elected and tend to serve more rural, conservative areas, were more supportive of the pick.

"I know David will give it his all," said Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs Association. "I'm pleased for him and I know he'll serve the country well."

Over a six-month period last year, four inmates died in the Milwaukee County Jail, which Sheriff Clarke oversees, including a baby who died shortly after she was born in the maximum security unit where her mother was held.

Another inmate, 38-year-old Terrill Thomas, died last April of dehydration after the jail cut off his water supply for a week. A jury has recommended criminal charges against seven Milwaukee County jail staffers but not against Sheriff Clarke. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm is weighing charges against the staffers and could charge more people or fewer.

Mr. Peterson, the sheriff's spokesman, said the "folks who passed away were terribly ill people" and that the role Sheriff Clarke was appointed to has "no connection to any controversy in Milwaukee." He declined to comment further.

In the radio interview, Sheriff Clarke said his experience on the local level will allow him to relay the concerns of law enforcement to the federal government.

Chris Burbank, a former Salt Lake City police chief, said that, given the alleged abuses at the jail, the hiring sends the wrong message to law enforcement.

"The choices being made in the arena of Homeland Security, of ICE, of the AGs office are very slanted toward heavy immigration enforcement and not paying attention to civil rights," said Mr. Burbank, now at the Center for Policing Equity, a research group focused on race and policing. "It's disappointing to see it go more and more in a direction that is not heading toward reform and improvement in law enforcement."

CMO Today: TV Takes On Digital; McDonald's Says Sorry for Dead Dad Ad; Target 's Online Rethink; Here's your morning roundup of the biggest marketing, advertising and media industry news and happenings.

Good morning. It's day two of the upfronts and the language is getting battle-like. We'll see if ESPN and ABC one-up the competition today.

Fox shows its teeth

YouTube spent much of its "NewFront" last week throwing grenades on TV's lawn. This week it was time for TV to pick them up and hurl them back. My Wall Street Journal colleague Joe Flint was over at Fox's upfront, where  the network announced a slate of entertainment shows  from veteran producers and a live staging of "Rent" in the hope of turning around declining ratings. Fox Networks' new ad sales chief, Joe Marchese , delivered the punches, muting his microphone to joke that ads are better with the sound on, saying Fox has five times the ad minutes as social networks, and touting its brand safety credentials. Even "Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane got in on the act , quipping that YouTube ads have been delivered next to "ISIS vids." Mr. MacFarlane's most risky joke of the night, however, was when he introduced Fox execs Dana Walden and Gary Newman on stage as "the only people at Fox not being sued."

NBC goes for the jugular

At its own presentation on Monday, NBC "went straight for Google's jugular,"  AdExchanger reported. Its chairman of ad sales, Linda Yaccarino , referenced YouTube 's brand safety woes, touted TV as "the most effective advertising means there is," and denigrated the ability of algorithms to be able to predict the popularity of TV shows like "This Is Us." Both NBC and Fox also used their upfronts to announce they will be using the "Video Quality Score" metric from analytics firm Moat across all their linear and on-demand programming. What else happened at the NBC upfront? Confetti cannons, Megyn Kelly, Jennifer Lopez, a performance from Jennifer Hudson, and the cast of "Will & Grace." My CMO Today colleague Alexandra Bruell tweeted: "[Overheard] at NBC Upfront: do you feel like you just got sucked into a portal to the 90s?"

McSorry

It'd be fascinating to understand what goes through the minds of a creative agency that suggests the subject of child bereavement would be a novel way to sell burgers—nd the marketer that signs off on it. You know where to find me, McDonald's and Leo Burnett. The fast food chain apologized on Monday for the "upset" its latest British TV ad caused , the BBC reported. The spot depicts a boy trying to work out what he had in common with his dead father, before discovering they were both huge Filet-o-Fish fans (doubly offensive and unrealistic in my book). U.K. ad regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority, tells me it is currently assessing the 100 or so complaints it has received from viewers, who say it is "inappropriate and insensitive" to use bereavement and grief to sell fast food. In response, McDonald's said it was merely trying to "highlight the role McDonald's has played in our customers' everyday lives -- both in good and difficult times." Give me a break. Drop the faux-sensitivity and show people with happy faces, saying "mmm" as they munch on a Big Mac.

On Target

Target is rethinking its digital strategy  after issuing a bleak profit warning, WSJ reports. "We're not trying to be the catalog of everything," said Target 's digital chief, Mike McNamara . The online "catalog of everything" category was won long ago by Amazon , and Wal-Mart is beating Target on the physical retail front, having lowered prices and refurbished its stores. The article details how Target 's e-commerce strategy has been somewhat of a mess to date: Potential acquisition talks have gone nowhere, its in-house startup developing a marketplace for third-party sellers was scrapped, a partnership with an app for picking up orders outside stores was dissolved, and important marketing and strategy executives have left the company. It appears Target 's digital initiatives now mostly focus around getting to a place that users already expect it to be at, including developing a new curbside-pickup service and speeding up shipments. But the retailer might do better to focus on providing higher-margin products and experiences consumers can't find anywhere else online.

Opinion
Loose Lips Sink Presidencies; The Russian intel story shows the price of Trump's lost credibility.

The state of the Trump Presidency has been perpetual turbulence, which seems to be how the principal likes it. The latest vortex is over Mr. Trump's disclosure of sensitive intel to the Russians—nd whatever the particulars of the incident, the danger is that Presidencies can withstand only so much turbulence before they come apart.

The Washington Postreported Monday night that in an Oval Office meeting last week Mr. Trump relayed high-level "code word" classified material obtained from an ally to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Cue another Washington meltdown. The President took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to defend himself, claiming an "absolute right" to disclose "facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety."

National Security AdviserH.R. McMaster put a finer point on it at a Tuesday press conference, though without denying key details. He said Mr. Trump's disclosure was "wholly appropriate" and didn't expose intelligence sources and methods.

Presidents sometimes share secrets with overseas leaders—ven to adversaries such as the Soviets during the Cold War—f they conclude the benefits of showing what the U.S. knows will aid diplomacy or strategic interests. From media accounts and his tweets, Mr. Trump said something about Islamic State's laptop bomb threat to airlines. He may well have been trying to convince the envoys of the menace ISIS poses to Russian lives and foreign-policy goals, like the Russian airliner that exploded over Sinai in 2015.

Then again, the Post story has Mr. Trump boasting about how great U.S. intelligence is and divulging the info on impulse to prove it. National security officials also asked the reporters to withhold specifics about the item in question, presumably because further disclosure could undermine efforts to counter the threat or endanger the lives of human assets.

Reports emerged on Tuesday that the ally that gathered the material is Israel, and the revelation could endanger this and other intelligence-sharing relationships. The Israelis may hold back if they think their dossiers will be laundered through the U.S. to the Russians and then get passed to their Iranian and Syrian clients, and other foreign services may lose confidence in the U.S.

Lt. Gen. McMaster said he disputed "the premise" of the Post story, which was that Mr. Trump had done something wrong or unbecoming. He confirmed that Mr. Trump made the decision ad hoc "in the context of the conversation," not before the meeting. The problem is that even if the President's conduct was "wholly appropriate," the story's premise is wholly plausible.

The portrait of an inexperienced, impulsive chief who might spill secrets to an overseas foe is one to which Mr. Trump has too often contributed. It was political mismanagement even to hold the Russian meeting, especially the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey amid the investigation of the Trump campaign's alleged Russian connection.

This eruption shows why a President's credibility is so important. If people don't believe Mr. Trump's words or trust his judgment, they won't give him the benefit of the doubt or be responsive if he asks for support. Last week the White House spent two days attributing Mr. Comey's firing to a Justice Department recommendation, only for Mr. Trump to insist in a TV interview that the pink slip came "regardless of recommendation."

News broke late Tuesday of Mr. Comey's contemporaneous notes that Mr. Trump asked him in February to "let this go," referring to the FBI probe of axed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that account of the conversation, but that would be more credible if its previous statements were more reliable.

Mr. Trump's strife and insults with the intelligence community were also bound to invite blowback. The Post report is sourced to "current and former U.S. officials," which raises the question of how former officials are privy to "code word" information, defined as anything that could be expected to cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security if disclosed. In that case the public leaks about Mr. Trump's actions, if true, will do more damage than whatever he said in private.

Mr. Trump is considering a White House shakeup, including cleaning out many of his top aides, but the White House always reflects the President's governing style. If Mr. Trump can't discipline himself, then no Jim Baker ex machina will make much difference.

Mr. Trump needs to appreciate how close he is to losing the Republicans he needs to pass the agenda that will determine if he is successful. Weeks of pointless melodrama and undisciplined comments have depleted public and Capitol Hill attention from health care and tax reform, and exhaustion is setting in. America holds elections every two years, and Mr. Trump's policy allies in Congress will drift away if he looks like a liability.

Millions of Americans recognized Mr. Trump's flaws but decided he was a risk worth taking. They assumed, or at least hoped, that he'd rise to the occasion and the demands of the job. If he cannot, he'll betray their hopes as his Presidency sinks before his eyes.

McMaster Says Information Trump Shared With Russians Was 'Wholly Appropriate'; National security adviser says Trump didn't discuss Islamic State-controlled territories that weren't already publicly known

WASHINGTON—resident Donald Trump's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, said Tuesday that counterterrorism information that Mr. Trump shared in a meeting with Russian officials in the Oval Office last week "was wholly appropriate."             

"What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation," said Gen. McMaster, in a briefing with White House reporters that had been set to focus on the president's coming first foreign trip. "It was wholly appropriate to share what the threat was in the context."             

Gen. McMaster would not discuss whether Mr. Trump discussed classified information to the Russian officials.              

Gen. McMaster said that the president "wasn't even aware of where this information came from. He wasn't briefed on the source."             

The Wall Street Journal reported  late Monday that Mr. Trump divulged details about Islamic State to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the meeting in a way that revealed enough information for them to potentially compromise the source of the intelligence, according to officials, who said the intelligence came from a U.S. ally.              

The Washington Post earlier reported that Mr. Trump shared sensitive information with the Russians and that it put intelligence relationships at risk, igniting a fresh firestorm in Washington.             

The intelligence Mr. Trump shared was provided to the U.S. by Israel, according to officials with direct knowledge of the matter. It came from a particularly valuable source of information about the Islamic State terrorist group's explosive-building ability, these officials said.                          

Mr.  Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that he had the "absolute right" to share counterterrorism information with Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting, fueling a rapidly escalating controversy over reports that he divulged sensitive intelligence obtained from an ally.             

"I have the absolute right" as president to share "facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He offered  an explanation why: "Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism."              

In its articles Monday on the subject, the Journal refrained from identifying Israel as the source of the intelligence. Trump administration officials said disclosing it could damage the two countries' intelligence relationship and jeopardize operations. The Journal decided to name Israel once the country's name was widely disseminated after reports by the New York Times and others Tuesday afternoon.             

In the briefing, Gen. McMaster said Mr. Trump didn't discuss Islamic State-controlled territories that weren't already publicly known in his meeting with Russian officials.              

"It was nothing that you would not know from open-source reporting," Gen. McMaster said of the president's discussion with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. "It had all to do with operations that are already ongoing have been made public for months."                           

Asked why White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert had reportedly placed calls to the directors of the CIA and NSA after the meeting if Mr. Trump hadn't disclosed any sensitive intelligence, Mr. McMaster said he hadn't spoken with Mr. Bossert but that the adviser could have done so "out of an overabundance of caution." He said he and other officials at the meeting, including national security adviser for strategy Dina Powell, didn't feel that the conversation was "inappropriate."             

Gen. McMaster added that the president had "in no way compromised any sources or methods in this conversation."             

He said in response to a question that he was "not concerned at all" about the potential for relationships with U.S. allies to be in danger.

Germany's Dispute With Turkey Escalates

BERLIN -- Germany threatened to pull forces involved in fighting Islamic State from a Turkish air base after Turkey banned lawmakers from visiting German troops, escalating tensions between the two countries.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday said Turkey's decision to block a visit to the Incirlik Air Base was "unfortunate" as it was "absolutely essential" for lawmakers to be able to visit the soldiers stationed there. Germany's parliament must authorize all military deployments abroad.

"We will continue talks with Turkey but in parallel we will also do what is set out in the mandate, that means, searching for alternatives," Ms. Merkel said.

The threat to pull forces underlines the growing loss of trust between the two North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies over recent months.The two countries have been clashing over a series of issues -- from the detention of German journalists to Turkish government efforts to gain support among Turks in Germany for a constitutional referendum expanding the presidency's powers.

Turkey didn't immediately comment on the development. But while Turkey and European allies have seen relations deteriorate this year, Ankara has taken a more proactive path toward strengthening relations with the U.S. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is meeting Tuesday with President Donald Trump in Washington, where discussion is expected to focus on deepening intelligence-sharing efforts with Turkey to fight Kurdish terrorists at home and Iraq while the Pentagon implements a plan to arm Kurdish forces in Syria.

In recent months, German officials have studied eight possible alternatives to the Turkish air base in Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus. But until Monday, officials had publicly stressed that the goal was to stay in Turkey.

That language changedas officials expressed exasperation with Turkey's actions.

Germany has about 250 soldiers, six Tornado reconnaissance planes and a refueling aircraft in Incirlik, where other countries that are part of an international coalition targeting Islamic State in Syria are also represented, including the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Denmark and Qatar.

Last June, Ankara barred German lawmakers from visiting the base after the German parliament voted to label the Ottoman-era massacre of Armenians a genocide.

Turkey relented and authorized a visit in early October, but several lawmakers had been waiting for months to be allowed to visit.

"The ban of lawmakers' visits and the reasons for it provided by Turkey are a slap in the face for all those who despite everything continue to search for a dialogue with Turkey," said Christine Lambrecht, a lawmaker with the Social Democrats.

The defense ministry said it would look more closely at alternatives but added that any move could take months. Jordan is one possibility, but security conditions are less ideal than in Incirlik, said a spokesman for the defense ministry.

According to the German foreign ministry, Turkey told Germany that the visit, which was due to begin Tuesday and had been known to Ankara for weeks, wasn't possible given the current state of German-Turkish relations. Ministry spokesman Martin Schafer said Turkey appeared to be angered by Germany's granting asylum to some Turkish military personnel amid a post-coup-attempt crackdown by Ankara.

Mr. Schafer said Germany had expressed its frustration with the ban via different channels. He also said Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel would raise the issue with other members of the anti-Islamic State coalition and NATO, including the U.S., in Washington later this week.

"We think this is a stumbling block in our joint efforts to defeat ISIS," Mr. Schafer said.

Mr. Schafer said the ban was especially disappointing as it came just days after the German foreign minister told Turkey's prime minister that Germany wanted to improve relations with Turkey, after the two clashed over the detention of a German journalist in Turkey.

World News: U.S., Syria Allies at Odds on Raqqa

WASHINGTON -- America's main military ally in Syria agreed to let Islamic State fighters escape from a key battle this week without conferring with its U.S. partners, who targeted the extremists as they tried to flee, Pentagon officials said Friday.

The unusual deal and U.S. response exposed a disconnect in the anti-Islamic State coalition on the eve of a pivotal offensive to retake Raqqa, the extremist group's biggest Syrian stronghold. It called into question whether the U.S. military will honor battlefield commitments made by its partners, and came as President Donald Trump this week signed off on plans to provide direct arms to Kurdish fighters leading the military coalition.

The U.S.-backed forces' deal with Islamic State helped end a monthslong battle for Tabqa Dam, a strategic site the extremist group has held since late 2013. The Syrian Democratic Forces allowed about 70 Islamic State fighters safe passage if they dismantled hidden bombs and gave up their heavy weapons, said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.

The SDF made the deal to protect civilians and ensure that Islamic State didn't destroy the dam, which could have posed a risk to communities in the flood zone, Capt. Davis said. But the U.S. military didn't take part in the deal or agree to ensure safe passage for Islamic State fighters, Capt. Davis said, making them fair game. As the fighters left, the U.S. military tracked them and targeted those who could be killed without potential harm to civilians, he said.

"This was an agreement for them to leave the Tabqa Dam and to leave the remaining portions of the city they held, but it doesn't change the fact that when we see ISIS fighters on the battlefield and we have a clean shot at them, we will continue to take it," he said.

Capt. Davis declined to answer whether the U.S. is bound in any way when an ally like the SDF make an agreement on the battlefield.

"I think SDF let them have safe passage out of Tabqa, but once they continued on the battlefield, I don't know if that's something we're required to honor," he said.

Coalition forces have worked closely with Syrian partners in the fight for Tabqa Dam. In March, American forces ferried SDF fighters by helicopter and boat to Tabqa so they could kick off the assault.

Seizure of the dam removes a key roadblock for the SDF, which is preparing to launch a major assault on Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria.

Pentagon officials have said in the past that Islamic State fighters can surrender on the battlefield, but haven't provided details on how such negotiations might proceed, or who would take the lead on such matters since local forces lead the fight in Syria and Iraq.

"The enemy is completely surrounded in west Mosul, and those who do not surrender to the Iraqi security forces will be killed there," Col. John Dorrian, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria said in February.

The U.S.-led coalition didn't respond to a request for comment or an explanation of policy.

Islamic State first took Tabqa Dam in 2013 and used it as a hideout for top-ranking militants and high-value prisoners with the confidence that the U.S. wouldn't bomb and possibly rupture the dam, which holds back Syria's largest reservoir, Lake Assad.

Good morning,

Trump Travails

President Trump said Thursday he had been planning to fire former FBI Director James Comey  regardless of any advice from the Justice Department because Mr. Comey was a "showboat" who he claimed had lost the faith of his employees. In his first full account of the events that led up to Mr. Comey's dismissal Tuesday, Mr. Trump contradicted the initial White House accounts that he acted after top Justice Department officials recommended Mr. Comey's ouster. The president also confirmed he had asked Mr. Comey whether he was personally a target of a federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. In the past three days, the administration's shifting explanations have led new Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  to insist that the White House correct the record on his role in the firing; Mr. Comey's acting successor, Andrew McCabe, to defend the FBI's integrity;  and Democrats to renew demands that an independent prosecutor take over the Russia probe.

My First Home

First-time buyers are rushing to buy homes  after a decade on the sidelines, promising to kick a housing market already flush with luxury sales into higher gear. Tracking home sales to a particular age group is hard, but a series of data points form a mosaic of a generation of young people ready to buy: The number of new-owner households was double the number of new-renter households in the first quarter of this year, the share of first-time buyers is creeping back toward the historical average and mortgages for first-time buyers are on the rise. For the first time in a decade, new households are overwhelmingly choosing to buy rather than rent. Accordingly, home builders are beginning to shift their focus away from luxury homes and toward those at lower price points to cater to this burgeoning millennial clientele.

The Jonas Touch

Howard Jonas has struck gold.  Again. The businessman and telecom speculator has agreed to sell one of his companies, a long-struggling wireless venture, to Verizon for $3.1 billion, after the price nearly doubled in recent weeks because of a bidding war between Verizon and AT&T that surprised him. It is a big premium for an obscure company called Straight Path Communications that has just nine employees and has yet to build out a network. This marks another windfall for Mr. Jonas, who made a splash in 2000 by selling a stake in internet-calling company Net2Phone for more than $1.1 billion in cash to AT&T . He used that windfall to fund an array of ventures, including looking for shale oil in Mongolia, publishing "Star Trek" comic books and trying to cure cancer. One of his forays led to the creation of Straight Path.

All That Glitters

Immortalized as West Egg and East Egg in F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," Long Island's Gold Coast is resurgent, but with a different population:  young families looking for good public schools and alternatives to nosebleed New York City home prices. Instead of seeking sprawling properties with large amounts of acreage, these buyers are fighting over postage-stamp-size properties with easy commutes to Manhattan. There were 5,754 home sales on Long Island (excluding the Hamptons and North Fork) in the first quarter of 2017—he most for that period in 14 years. The uptick is most keenly felt in sought-after North Shore school districts where commute times to Manhattan hover around 30 minutes. To meet the demand, builders are snapping up small houses in coveted areas, demolishing them and constructing larger homes.

U.S. and Its Syrian Allies At Odds Over Deal That Let Islamic State Flee; Move exposes disconnect in anti-Islamic State coalition on eve of pivotal offensive to retake Raqqa

WASHINGTON—merica's main military ally in Syria agreed to let Islamic State fighters escape from a key battle earlier this week without conferring with its U.S. partners who targeted the extremists as they tried to flee, Pentagon officials said Friday.

The unusual deal and U.S. response exposed a disconnect in the anti-Islamic State coalition on the eve of a pivotal offensive to retake Raqqa, the extremist group's biggest Syrian stronghold. And it called into question whether the U.S. military will honor battlefield commitments made by its partners.

The deal with Islamic State helped U.S.-backed forces end a monthslong battle with Islamic State for Tabqa Dam, a strategic stronghold the extremist group has held since late-2013.

To bring the battle to an end, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces allowed about 70 Islamic State fighters safe passage if they dismantled hidden bombs and gave up their heavy weapons, said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.

The U.S.-backed fighters made the deal to protect civilians and ensure that Islamic State didn't destroy the dam, which could have posed a risk to communities in the flood zone, Capt. Davis said.

But the U.S. military didn't take part in the deal or agree to ensure safe passage for Islamic State fighters, Capt. Davis said, making them fair game. As the fighters left, the U.S. military tracked them and targeted those who could be killed without potential harm to civilians, he said.

"I think SDF let them have safe passage out of Tabqa, but once they continued on the battlefield, I don't know if that's something we're required to honor," he said.

Seizure of the dam removes a key roadblock for the SDF, which is preparing to launch a major assault on Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed off on plans to provide direct arms to Kurdish fighters leading the military coalition. While the move angered Turkey, which considers the Syrian Kurdish fighters to be terrorists, it paves the way for the SDF to turn its attention toward Raqqa.

Pentagon officials have said in the past that Islamic State fighters can surrender on the battlefield, but haven't provided details on how such negotiations might proceed, or who would take the lead on such matters since local forces lead the fight in Syria and Iraq.

World News: Kurd-Led Force Cleared To Take  ISIS  Bastion

BEIRUT -- A Kurdish-led military force in Syria is closing in on Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa after taking the strategic Tabqa dam nearby, days after the fighters won rare approval from both Washington and Damascus to battle the extremist group.

Islamic State's loss of the dam on the Euphrates River about 30 miles southwest of its Syrian seat of power is a major blow to the terror group, which held the structure for more than three years. The U.S. long worried the militants would rig the dam with explosives, allowing it to unleash floods on the surrounding population and American-backed forces.

The Kurd-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces captured Tabqa Wednesday, a day after the U.S. pledged to arm the fighters and the Damascus government for the first time endorsed their battle against Islamic State. At a Monday news conference in Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem complimented the SDF's fight against Islamic State and described the force as legitimate.

The SDF is now the only ground force with both U.S. and Syrian government approval to fight Islamic State as the offensive on Raqqa draws near. While anti-government rebel factions have also fought Islamic State, the Syrian government has long deemed them terrorists in light of their goal to oust President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

As the Kurdish-led fighters supported by U.S. Special Operations Forces on the ground inch closer to Raqqa, the question of who will hold the city the day after it falls is becoming more urgent. Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and its Syrian Arab rebel allies oppose the rival Kurds leading the battle and fear they will try to hold onto the majority-Arab city after it is captured.

Arab rebels particularly distrust the YPG, the Syrian Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF, because it has used the U.S.-backed fight against Islamic State to take over a large swath of territory across northern Syria -- including predominantly Arab cities and towns -- with the expressed goal of carving out a semi-autonomous Kurdish region. The rebels and opposition activists have long accused the YPG of colluding with the Syrian regime for its own benefit.

President Donald Trump has made clear he opposes the expensive nation-building missions that have historically accompanied U.S. counterterrorism operations to support local governments and prevent insurgents from returning.

For these reasons, Western diplomats say the post-capture plan is for the SDF to hand over the administration of Raqqa to a local civilian council friendly to the Syrian regime. That council could eventually transfer control of the city back to the regime, these diplomats said.

On Thursday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said Moscow supports the formation of local councils to administer territory taken from Islamic State but said they must not circumvent the Syrian government's authority, in comments carried by Interfax news agency.

An official from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is fighting for the Syrian regime, recently described Kurdish cooperation with the Syrian government as a win for both sides. The regime treated the ethnic minority as second-class citizens before the outbreak of war in 2011.

"Now the regime needs the Kurds and will count them as loyal citizens and improve their services if they cooperate," the Hezbollah official said. "For a long time, many of them didn't have the Syrian nationality or even basic government services."

Kurd-Led Force Homes In on  ISIS  Bastion With Assent of U.S. and Syria Alike; After taking crucial nearby dam, SDF is poised to capture Raqqa, Islamic State's Syrian centerpiece

BEIRUT— Kurdish-led military force backed by Washington and now approved by Damascus is closing in on Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa after taking the strategic Tabqa dam nearby.

The Kurd-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces captured Tabqa Wednesday, a day after the U.S. pledged to arm the fighters. On Monday, the Damascus government for the first time endorsed the group's battle against Islamic State, with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem complimenting the SDF's fight against Islamic State at a press conference in Damascus, describing the force as legitimate.

The SDF is now the only ground force with both U.S. and Syrian government approval in the fight against Islamic State as the offensive on Raqqa draws near. The group has long co-existed with the Syrian government, unlike U.S.- backed factions that Damascus deems terrorists in light of their goal to oust President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

Islamic State's loss of the dam on the Euphrates River about 30 miles southwest of its Syrian seat of power is a major blow to the terror group, which held the structure for more than three years. The U.S. long worried the militants would rig the dam with explosives, allowing it to unleash floods on the surrounding population and American-backed forces.

The SDF launched its attack in March from numerous fronts on the town of Tabqa and its nearby dam, which provides water and electricity for hundreds of thousands of people. After weeks of battle and nearly surrounding the town, the SDF negotiated the withdrawal of dozens of Islamic State militants from the area to protect the dam infrastructure, according to the U.S. Central Command.

In March, Islamic State accused the U.S. of launching airstrikes on the dam, saying it caused potentially devastating damage.

As the Kurdish-led fighters supported by U.S. Special Operations Forces on the ground inch closer to Raqqa, the question of who will hold the city the day after it falls is becoming more urgent. Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and its Syrian Arab rebel allies oppose the rival Kurds leading the battle and fear they will try to hold onto the majority-Arab city after it is captured.

Arab rebels particularly distrust the YPG, the Syrian Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF, because it has used the U.S.-backed fight against Islamic State to take over a large swath of territory across northern Syria—ncluding predominantly Arab cities and towns—ith the expressed goal of carving out a semi-autonomous Kurdish region. The rebels and opposition activists have long accused the YPG of colluding with the Syrian regime for its own benefit.

U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear he opposes the expensive nation-building missions that have historically accompanied U.S. counterterrorism operations to support local governments and prevent insurgents from returning.

For these reasons, Western diplomats say the post-capture plan is for the SDF to hand over the administration of Raqqa to a local civilian council friendly to the Syrian regime. That council could eventually transfer control of the city back to the regime, these diplomats said.

The formation of the local civilian council for Raqqa, composed of both Kurds and Arabs, was announced last month. On Thursday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said Moscow supports the formation of local councils to administer territory taken from Islamic State but said they must not circumvent the Syrian government's authority, in comments carried by Interfax news agency.

"The U.S. military will be going in [to Raqqa] and trying to figure out who the tribal leaders are," said an American official involved in the anti-Islamic State campaign. "The regime knows these details. They have a natural home-field advantage and have a way of slowly getting back in. We won't be in Raqqa in 2020, but the regime will be there."

Western officials say the SDF operation that unfolded in the northern Syrian city of Manbij last year could serve as a blueprint for Raqqa's eventual handover to Damascus. The Kurdish-led force took Manbij from Islamic State in August and handed over some surrounding towns to the Syrian and allied Russian armies in March.

An official from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is fighting for the Syrian regime, recently described increasing Kurdish cooperation with the Syrian government as a win for both sides. With Damascus poised to retake much of the country with help from Iran, Russia, Hezbollah and other Shiite foreign fighters, the official said the Syrian Kurds realize they can gain from cooperating with Mr. Assad's government. The regime treated the ethnic minority as second-class citizens before the outbreak of war in 2011.

"Now the regime needs the Kurds and will count them as loyal citizens and improve their services if they cooperate," the Hezbollah official said. "For a long time, many of them didn't have the Syrian nationality or even basic government services."

Ahead of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Washington next week to meet Mr. Trump, Turkish officials have opposed U.S. plans to liberate Raqqa using the SDF. They have instead lobbied for a Turkish-trained Syrian Arab force to take the city.

The U.S. has been skeptical of Turkish claims that it has a large enough rebel force to take Raqqa. Turkey views the SDF as an extension of the main Syrian Kurdish militia, the YPG, which is closely tied to the PKK— group fighting for autonomy within Turkey that Ankara deems a terror organization.

The Pentagon's statement Tuesday that it would arm the SDF to take Raqqa ends the debate and political jockeying over which force will be used to spearhead the offensive.

American officials confirmed Thursday that Tabqa dam was taken by the SDF, backed by U.S. ground forces. The extremists' hold on their Iraqi capital in Mosul is also near collapse in a separate offensive led by the Iraqi army, backed by the U.S. and other Western countries.

Trump To Arm Kurdish Fighters In Syria

President Donald Trump approved plans to directly arm Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State in Syria, U.S. officials said, paving the way for an offensive against the extremist group's de facto capital but angering Turkish allies who view the Kurdish fighters as terrorists.

After months of internal debate, Mr. Trump on Tuesday approved a proposal to arm the YPG, the Syrian Kurdish militia that the U.S. military considers its most reliable military ally in the country.

But Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, considers the YPG to be a terrorist group that threatens its borders, and it has long opposed the U.S. plans.

The decision sets the stage for the YPG and its Arab allies to launch an offensive on Islamic State in Raqqa, one of the extremist group's last major strongholds in the region.

Top Turkish officials on Monday visited the White House for a tense meeting to discuss the U.S. plans.

On Tuesday, the Pentagon said the U.S. is moving ahead with the plans, despite Turkish objections.

"We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey," said Dana White, the chief Pentagon spokeswoman. "We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the U.S. is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our NATO ally."

The move to arm the YPG comes one week before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to fly to Washington to meet Mr. Trump. Privately, some Turkish officials said Mr. Erdogan might cancel his plans because of the White House decision, but it remains unclear what impact the move could have on next week's meetings.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he didn't know if Mr. Trump had yet discussed the issue with Mr. Erdogan but said the U.S. is committed to protecting Turkey from additional security risks. "The fight for Raqqa will be long and difficult . . . and another step towards eliminating ISIS."

Two weeks ago, over American objections, Turkish warplanes bombed YPG forces who work alongside U.S. special operations forces in Syria, killing at least 18 fighters. U.S. officials said Turkey gave them less than an hour's notice of the planned attack, which gave them little time to ensure that American forces were out of harm's way.

In a risky attempt to defuse tensions, the U.S. military started patrolling in Syria near the Turkish border after the Turkish airstrikes. Turkish officials said they would continue to attack the YPG in Syria, despite U.S. objections.

The U.S. military began working with the YPG in 2014 when it dropped weapons and ammunition for the Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State in Kobani, a small Syrian town on the border with Turkey.

Since then, the U.S. has steadily stepped up its support for the YPG by carrying out airstrikes to aid the fighters. The YPG now leads a Kurdish-Arab coalition known as the Syrian Democratic Forces that has largely encircled Raqqa.

Because of Turkey's concerns, the U.S. has since stopped short of directly arming the YPG -- until now.

The decision sets the stage for the U.S. military to provide the YPG with more firepower to take on Islamic State.

The U.S. will provide small arms, ammunition and machine guns, and possibly some nonlethal assistance, such as light trucks, to the Kurdish forces, a U.S. official said.

Many of the arms and other shipments of equipment have been pre-positioned in anticipation of a decision to arm the Kurdish force, U.S. officials have said.

Once the shipments of the arms begin in coming weeks, they will be provided to Kurdish forces in increments as a way of building trust and ensuring that the shipments don't exceed the capability of the Kurdish forces to absorb them, said the U.S. official.

"We will be supplying them only with enough arms and ammo to accomplish each interim objective," said the U.S. official.

Although Kurdish forces are highly regarded and trusted by U.S. special-operations forces, the arms will still be parceled out, at least initially, in what the U.S. official characterized as "drop, op, and assess" approach. That means the shipments will be dropped, an operation will be performed, and the U.S. will assess the success of that mission before providing more arms, the U.S. official said.

 ISIS  Claims Execution of Russian Intelligence Agent; The militant group says video shows beheading of Russian agent who had attempted to infiltrate one of its fighting units

MOSCOW—slamic State has published a video showing what it says was the beheading of a Russian intelligence agent who had attempted to infiltrate one of the extremist group's elite fighting units before he was seized.

Russia's main intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, didn't respond to questions about the video, which was published by a media outlet affiliated with Islamic State and reported Tuesday by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist activity.

The Wall Street Journal couldn't independently determine the videos authenticity or verify any of its claims.

Neither the date of the purported beheading nor its location are described in the video, but in response to its publication, Russia's Defense Ministry said all Russian forces in Syria were accounted for.

Russia provides crucial military support to the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. Islamic State is fighting both the regime and other rebel groups, as it struggles in neighboring Iraq to hold remnants of western Mosul, its last remaining urban stronghold in that country.

The release of the video coincided with commemorations in Russia on Tuesday marking Victory Day, the anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. One of the most important holidays on the Russian calender, it is a traditional showcase of the country's military might and its latest weaponry.

In the video, the purported victim, speaking in Russian and dressed in a black, button-down shirt with black trousers, identifies himself by name, gives his rank as captain and says he worked for the Federal Security Service, or FSB.

He says he joined an Islamist extremist group in Russia's predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region before traveling to Islamic State-controlled territory to infiltrate that organization.

He is later shown against a background of empty, rolling sand dunes. Behind him is man, his face exposed, wearing a khaki green military gear and holding a knife in his right hand.

Previous videos of executions carried out by Islamic State and whose authenticity was later confirmed show a similar landscape. Unlike nearly all of those videos, however, the supposed executioner isn't disguised.

Pro-Islamic State social media accounts said the man was taken into custody after he asked several times to join a special unit under the commander of Islamic State's former war minister, Omar Al Shishani, and aroused the suspicion of the group's police.

Mr. Putin has justified Moscow's military intervention in Syria partly as an opportunity to fight thousands of Russian Islamist extremists that have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight on the side of Islamic State.

Russia has been fighting an Islamist insurgency in its predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region since the end of the Second Chechen War in 2009. Nearly all insurgent groups in the North Caucasus have pledged allegiance to Islamic State.

At Tuesday's Victory Day parade in the Russian capital, Mr. Putin said that while Russia was prepared to deal with international terrorist threats on its own, it was also was ready to work with other countries to fight the scourge.

"Today life itself demands we boost our defense potential but for an effective battle with terrorism, extremism, neo-Nazism and other threats, we must consolidate the forces of the international community," he said in a nationally televised speech.

The man accused of planting and detonating bombs in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood won't be allowed to move his trial out of New York City, a federal judge ruled on Monday.

Lawyers representing Ahmad Khan Rahimi, who faces terrorism charges related to the September 2016 bombings, had asked that the trial be relocated to another venue, such as in Vermont. The lawyers said Mr. Rahimi, 29 years old, couldn't get a fair trial in New York.

U.S. District Judge Richard Berman denied that request Monday, noting that other defendants whose cases received substantial publicity and media coverage had been tried in New York City.

"The court has little or no doubt that a fair and impartial jury can be impaneled in this case, and that defendant Rahimi will receive a fair trial," Judge Berman said in court.

Furthermore, the district from which the jury pool draws includes not only Manhattan but the Bronx, Rockland and Westchester counties, among others, he said.

Federal prosecutors contend that Mr. Rahimi—ho was born in Afghanistan and is a U.S. citizen—lanted bombs in New Jersey and in Chelsea last September. One of the Chelsea devices, which appeared to be made from a pressure cooker and placed in a dumpster, detonated, injuring more than 30 people and causing millions of dollars in damages, prosecutors said.

The defense attorneys, citing survey data, had argued that many potential jurors were either in Chelsea on the day of the bombing or knew someone who was.

They also said local media coverage had jumped to unfair conclusions and prejudiced the jury pool. In court filings, they cited articles with headlines such as, "Chelsea bomb suspect's blood-soaked diary full of ISIS praise."

Assistant U.S. Attorney Emil Bove said unbiased jurors could be found through typical questioning and instructions. "There is a well established procedure for addressing this," Mr. Bove told the judge on Monday.

Mr. Rahimi, wearing a white skullcap and blue jail uniform, quietly watched the proceedings. He also faces related charges in federal and state courts in New Jersey.

Court documents indicate that the lawyers had been involved in plea negotiations since at least February. It was unclear if the negotiations are ongoing.

Mr. Rahimi's New York trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 2. He faces up to life in prison if convicted.

World News: Islamic State Leader In Afghanistan Killed

KABUL -- The U.S. military on Sunday said its forces killed Sheikh Abdul Hasib, Islamic State's leader in Afghanistan, in a joint raid with Afghan soldiers in the eastern Nangarhar province.

A combined force of U.S. Army Rangers and Afghan Special Forces -- who were dropped into the Mohmand Valley near the border with Pakistan by helicopter -- carried out the operation on the night of April 26 in which a number of the extremist group's top commanders also were killed, according to a U.S. military statement.

The U.S. military has since said it is investigating whether the two U.S. soldiers who died in the operation were killed by friendly fire.

"This successful joint operation is another important step in our relentless campaign," said General John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. "This is the second ISIS-K emir we have killed in nine months, along with dozens of their leaders and hundreds of their fighters."

The operation took place in the same area where the U.S. military dropped one of the largest nonnuclear bombs in its arsenal, nicknamed the "Mother of All Bombs," on an Islamic State tunnel-and-cave complex.

In the weeks leading up to the blast, U.S. and Afghan forces killed more than a dozen Islamic State fighters, driving the militants out of villages that had been occupied for years into the mountains, according to Afghan special forces.

Residents there were returning home for the first time in years to inspect the damage. Locals interviewed by The Wall Street Journal during the visit to the area were supportive of the strike and hoped for compensation after years of hardship.

The Islamic State Khorasan, as the Afghan affiliate is known, emerged in Afghanistan in late 2014, as most coalition troops were withdrawing from the country. The group established a foothold in the east and has been working to win pockets of support in other parts of the country.

The U.S. military said Islamic State's Afghan leader was responsible for a recent attack on a military hospital in Kabul that killed more than 100 people.

Islamic State's presence in the area has shrunk in the weeks since U.S. and Afghan forces have pressed an offensive into its eastern stronghold.

U.S. Dismisses Russia's Ban on Aircraft Over Syrian Safe Zones; Areas were established without explicit U.S. consent during Russian talks with Turkey, Iran

A Russian envoy said U.S. aircraft are barred from flying over the "de-escalation zones" that Russia, Iran and Turkey recently agreed to establish in Syria, but U.S. officials dismissed the admonition as it continues operations to target Islamic State.

The disagreement left deeply uncertain the status of the zones that were established this week without explicit U.S. consent during talks on Syria in Kazakhstan.

Alexander Lavrentiev, Russian President Vladimir Putin 's envoy for Syria, didn't indicate what role Russian aircraft would have in enforcing the no-fly rule. The ban also applies to aircraft of the U.S.-led international coalition fighting Islamic State militants, said the envoy,

"From this time forward, these zones are closed for their flights…ith or without notification," Mr. Lavrentiev was quoted as saying in the Kazakh capital Astana, where Russia, Iran and Turkey signed a memorandum on Thursday to create at least four safe zones across Syria.

The zones being set up under the agreement are intended to bolster fragile cease-fires and allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the return of refugees, officials from the three nations said.

U.S. officials had reacted warily earlier this week to the agreement, saying any deal involving Iran was suspect and noting that past efforts to reduce violence in Syria had failed. After Mr. Lavrentiev's comments Friday, the Trump administration said it didn't plan to change the U.S. posture.

"As we said yesterday, the United States supports any effort that can genuinely de-escalate the violence in Syria, insure unhindered humanitarian access, focus energies on the defeat of ISIS and other terrorists, and create the conditions for a credible political resolution of the conflict," a State Department official said Friday.

"The coalition will continue to strike ISIS targets in Syria," the official said. "The campaign to defeat ISIS will continue at the same relentless pace as it is proceeding now."

Another official in the administration said, "This agreement does not and cannot limit the ability of the United States and our coalition to continue the campaign to defeat ISIS."

Russia, Iran and Turkey support opposing sides in the war, with Moscow and Tehran backing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and Ankara allied with rebel groups opposed to him. Russian air support for ground operations by government forces and their allies has been crucial in tipping the war in the regime's favor.

Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said in a televised briefing Friday that the memorandum is to go into effect Saturday and that the Russian air force had suspended operations in the four zones since Monday.

The U.S.-led coalition and Russian warplanes have managed to operate in Syria's crowded airspace, but concerns have persisted about the potential for collisions. The U.S. and Russia have communication channels to avert midair encounters, although Moscow had threatened to close them following U.S. missile strikes against Syrian regime aircraft last month.

Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, chief of the main operational directorate of the Russian General Staff, said the memorandum allows the formation of additional zones, "depending on the development of the situation."

Gen. Rudskoi said Syrian troops in the de-escalation zones would be redeployed to central and eastern Syria to focus on Islamic State targets, where they will be supported by Russian air power. Russia, Iran and Turkey will be responsible for checkpoints leading into the zones as well as administration of additional buffer areas, he added.

U.S. officials plan to hold meetings with Russian and Turkish officials in coming days. Tom Shannon, the acting deputy secretary of state, will meet his Russian counterpart next week in New York to discuss what the State Department said is "a range of bilateral issues."

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on the phone Friday to discuss "efforts to de-escalate the continuing conflict in Syria," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. They will also meet next week on the sidelines of an Arctic Council meeting in Alaska.

Opposition monitoring organizations and international human rights organizations blame Russian and Syrian aircraft for the majority of civilian casualties in Syria.

Neither the Syrian government nor the rebels fighting it are signatories to the safe-zone agreement, the details and enforcement of which remain to be worked out. Some members of the rebel delegation attending the talks in Kazakhstan walked out of the signing ceremony to protest the presence of Iranian representatives.

Mr. Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the de-escalation areas during a phone conversation on Tuesday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed them earlier this week during talks in Sochi, Russia, with Mr. Putin.

Mr. Lavrentiev said Moscow would like United Nations Security Council approval of the plan, but added that its blessing isn't necessary.

The safe zones are the latest step in the so-called Astana process, the negotiating effort backed by Moscow, Ankara and Tehran to guarantee a number of local cease-fires across Syria.

The U.N . also is conducting talks aimed at reaching a political settlement of the war, now in its seventh year.

U.S. Is Caught Between Ally Turkey and Kurdish Partner in Syria; American forces take steps to avert attack by Ankara on militia aiding  ISIS  fight

By Yaroslav Trofimov 
957 words

It's rare for American forces in the Middle East to fly the Stars and Stripes from their armored vehicles. Usually they try to blend in, with special-operations troops often going as far as donning local uniforms.

But now, part of the U.S. mission in northern Syria is to literally show the American flag. The goal is to forestall attacks by America's NATO ally Turkey on America's key partner in the fight against Islamic State, the main Syrian Kurdish militia known as YPG.

In an unusual alignment, Russia is also flying its flag, with small, highly visible units deployed in the Syrian Kurdish enclave of Afrin. Russia and the Syrian regime have increasingly collaborated with the YPG and—ike the U.S.—ublicized recent deployments, aiming to deter Turkey.

This surreal standoff shows just how much the six-year Syrian war has upended the region's alliances. It is also an illustration of the extent to which America's focus on defeating Islamic State has come at the expense of its broader relationship with Turkey, an economic powerhouse of 80 million people that has NATO's second-largest army and exerts influence across the region.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his authority bolstered by a controversial referendum last month, is now on a mission to persuade the world's powers that Turkish interests can't be ignored—nd that whatever the Syrian Kurds may deliver isn't worth a rupture with Ankara.

He visited President Vladimir Putin in Russia this week and is heading for a meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington in mid-May. The main aim is to scuttle American plans for YPG-led forces to seize Islamic State's main remaining stronghold of Raqqa, a city that is overwhelmingly Arab.

That won't be an easy sell.

"The American military really likes working with YPG. They feel there is no alternative to take Raqqa and they feel they have to take Raqqa sooner rather than later," said Robert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria and a scholar at the Middle East Institute. "I don't think this administration has ever been convinced that the Turks have a viable alternative plan or alternative force. This is going to be a difficult time with Erdogan."

U.S. forces were scrambled to the Syrian-Turkish border last week, moving in high-profile convoys that flew large American flags after Turkish airstrikes killed dozens of YPG fighters in Syria. Mr. Erdogan has since threatened to mount a cross-border operation into YPG-held territory and said he was "saddened" by public U.S. support for the group.

Turkey considers the YPG and its political parent PYD just a front for the PKK, or the Kurdistan Workers' Party— group which seeks to split off Kurdish areas within Turkey itself and is classified as terrorist by Ankara and Washington. Turkey last week simultaneously launched airstrikes against the YPG in Syria and targeted PKK bases in northern Iraq.

Aydin Selcen, a security analyst who served as Turkey's consul-general in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq and as a senior diplomat in Washington, said Mr. Erdogan is deliberately escalating in Syria and Iraq to gain leverage with Mr. Trump ahead of the trip.

"Mr. Erdogan wished to prove to the U.S. and the coalition that when and if Ankara is convinced of a national-security threat emanating from Syria or Iraq, it is ready to take unilateral action to protect its interests," Mr. Selcen said. "The airstrikes in his thinking will allow him to negotiate with both the U.S. and the Russian Federation leaders from a position of strength."

Turkey and its Syrian allies also hope to woo Mr. Trump by highlighting what they say is the risk that the Kurdish group—hich has a long history of ties with Tehran—ould become Iran's Trojan horse in the region.

"The most influential partner of the PYD are the Iranians, not the Americans," said Safwan Akkash, a senior leader of the moderate Syrian opposition, which is backed by Turkey and Saudi Arabia. "We know that the Kurds are ready to cooperate with any party that will support their cause."

The U.S. government, while acknowledging the links between PKK and YPG, has long argued that the two organizations are different. The State Department expressed deep concern over last week's Turkish airstrikes which hit what it described as America's "partner forces" in Syria.

So far, the YPG in Syria—nlike the PKK in Iraq—asn't launched significant cross-border operations into Turkey, in part because of American and Russian involvement.

"The Americans know that there is no threat to Turkey from YPG areas, so no one is convinced by the Turkish argument," said Mutlu Civiroglu, a Kurdish analyst who follows the YPG.

Turkish concerns aren't entirely without merit, however. Ankara views the establishment of a PKK-affiliated entity along its southern border as an "existential threat," said James Jeffrey, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and to Iraq who is currently a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

"What the Turks fear is that the Americans have agreed to give the PYD a statelet in all of northern Syria" in exchange for securing Raqqa, Mr. Jeffrey said. "That would allow the PKK to outflank Turkey, so that what was just an insurgency in a part of southeast Turkey could become a civil war."

Trump Adviser Kushner's Undisclosed Partners Include Goldman and Soros; Investments show ties to major finance and technology names

By Jean Eaglesham, Juliet Chung and Lisa Schwartz

Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, is currently in business with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and billionaires George Soros and Peter Thiel, according to people familiar with the matter and securities filings.

The previously undisclosed business relationships with titans of the financial and technology worlds are through a real-estate tech startup called Cadre that Mr. Kushner cofounded and currently partly owns.

Goldman and Messrs. Soros and Thiel, as well as other billionaires' firms, also have stakes in the company, which is based in a Manhattan building owned by the Kushner family's company, according to people close to Cadre.

The Cadre stake is one of many interests—nd ties to large financial institutions—hat Mr. Kushner didn't identify on his government financial-disclosure form, according to a Wall Street Journal review of securities and other filings. Others include loans totaling at least $1 billion, from more than 20 lenders, to properties and companies part-owned by Mr. Kushner, the Journal found. He has also provided personal guarantees on more than $300 million of the debt, according to the analysis.

In his disclosure form filed earlier this year, Mr. Kushner didn't identify Cadre as among his hundreds of assets. The Journal identified his Cadre stake through a review of securities and other filings as well as interviews with people familiar with the company and Mr. Kushner's finances.

Jamie Gorelick, a lawyer representing Mr. Kushner, said in a statement that his stake in Cadre is housed in a company he owns, BFPS Ventures LLC. His ownership of BFPS is reported on his disclosure form, although it doesn't mention Cadre.

Ms. Gorelick said the Cadre stake is described in a revised version of his disclosure form that will be made public after it has been certified by ethics officials. She said Mr. Kushner has previously discussed his Cadre ownership with the Office of Government Ethics and that Mr. Kushner has "resigned from Cadre's board, assigned his voting rights and reduced his ownership share."

A spokesman for the Office of Government Ethics didn't respond to a request to comment.

Ms. Gorelick said it is "very normal" for a financial-disclosure form to be revised and that the form was prepared by Mr. Kushner's lawyers on his behalf. A White House spokeswoman referred questions to Mr. Kushner's lawyer.

Trevor Potter, a Republican former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, and other ethics experts said investments such as Mr. Kushner's ownership of Cadre typically need to be disclosed. They said Mr. Kushner didn't appear to violate disclosure rules by not publicly reporting his business-related debts and guarantees. But they said such arrangements ideally should be disclosed, in part because they could force Mr. Kushner to recuse himself from certain issues involving the lenders.

"Anything that presents a potential for the conflict of interest should be disclosed so that the public and the press can monitor this," Mr. Potter said.

Ethics experts' concern is that Mr. Kushner's business connections could jeopardize his impartiality in certain areas and that, absent disclosures, the public is in the dark about potential conflicts.

Mr. Kushner's rapidly expanding responsibilities range from working on a Middle East peace deal to making the federal government operate more efficiently. As a senior federal official, he is bound by ethics laws that require him to recuse himself from matters that would directly affect his financial interests.

Ms. Gorelick, who was deputy attorney general in former President Bill Clinton's administration, said Mr. Kushner will "recuse consistent with government ethics rules."

Mr. Kushner, the 36-year-old scion of a real-estate family, agreed with federal ethics officials to divest himself of more than 80 assets after he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were hired by her father, President Donald Trump, as senior aides. White House officials have said some of the sales were needed to avoid potential conflicts between Mr. Kushner's far-reaching job duties and his personal financial interests.

Mr. Kushner is retaining more than 200 other assets, worth a total of at least $116 million, according to his disclosures. These are mostly apartments and office blocks around the U.S. Like his father-in-law, he has declined to put these assets in a blind trust, which ethics experts regard as the cleanest way to avoid conflicts of interest. Someone close to Mr. Kushner said there are practical problems that made a blind trust not a realistic option.

Mr. Kushner co-founded Cadre in 2014 with his brother, Joshua Kushner, and Ryan Williams, a 29-year-old friend and former employee of Kushner Cos., the family-controlled business that Mr. Kushner ran until recently. Cadre markets properties to prospective investors, who can put their money into specific buildings or into an investment fund run by Cadre, which collects fees on each deal.

To get off the ground, Cadre turned to a Goldman Sachs fund and a number of high-profile investors. Among them were the venture-capital firms of Mr. Thiel, Silicon Valley's most prominent supporter of the GOP president, and Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems Inc., according to Cadre's website. Personal backers include Chinese entrepreneur David Yu, co-founder with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Jack Ma of a Shanghai-based private-equity firm, hedge-fund manager Daniel Och and real-estate magnate Barry Sternlicht, people close to Cadre said.

Cadre also secured a $250 million line of credit from the family office of Mr. Soros, a top Democratic donor who Mr. Trump criticized during his presidential campaign, the people close to the company said. Mr. Soros's family office is also an investor in Cadre.

The investors declined or didn't respond to requests for public comment on their backing of Cadre, but a person familiar with Mr. Soros's family office said it had invested in early 2015 before Mr. Trump declared his presidential candidacy.

Cadre has solicited money from investors for several Kushner Cos. real-estate projects, according to information sent to prospective investors and reviewed by the Journal. Jared Kushner personally has stakes in some of the real-estate projects for which Cadre has raised money, according to Cadre documents and his disclosure form.

While Mr. Williams acts as the public face of Cadre, Mr. Kushner remains one of the owners, with the power to "influence the [firm's] management or policies," according to the latest public information on file with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Mr. Kushner's company JCK Cadre LLC is shown as owning 25% to 50% of Quadro Partners Inc., which owns at least 75% of RealCadre LLC, which does business as Cadre. Mr. Kushner has reduced his ownership stake to less than 25%, his lawyer Ms. Gorelick said.

Mr. Williams, chief executive of Cadre, said the company has been working with regulators to update its public filings to "reflect Jared's nonoperational, nonmanagement relationship with the company, which has been in place since the inauguration."

BFPS Ventures, the company that Mr. Kushner's lawyer said holds his Cadre stake, is shown on his financial-disclosure form as owning unspecified New York real estate valued at more than $50 million. The form adds that "the conflicting assets of this interest have been divested."

Beyond Cadre, some of the assets Mr. Kushner is holding on to are hard to pinpoint, partly because they are housed in entities with generic names such as "KC Dumbo Office," according to the disclosure form.

The Journal matched many of the assets to specific real-estate investments. An analysis of the debts on those properties, using real-estate data services PropertyShark and Trepp LLC as well as property records, found ties to a broad swath of U.S. and foreign banks, private-equity firms, real-estate companies and government-owned lenders.

Lenders to Mr. Kushner, either directly or via properties he co-owns, include Bank of America Corp., Blackstone Group LP, Citigroup Inc., UBS Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC. Royal Bank of Scotland didn't respond to requests for comment; representatives of the other firms declined to comment.

Mr. Kushner will recuse himself from matters to which Deutsche Bank or RBS are parties because he has provided personal guarantees on their loans, said a person familiar with his ethics arrangement.

Facebook and Diversity; How far is Sheryl Sandberg's company leaning in?

Corrections & Amplifications

An earlier version of this article gave the incorrect percentage of women in technical roles at Facebook. Women account for 17% of technical roles at the company.

Now this is awkward. Just as Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is rolling out a new book, along comes fresh evidence that America's most celebrated coach for women in the workplace seems to be presiding over a company that frustrates the relatively few women it employs. According to the Journal:

Last year, a longtime engineer at Facebook Inc. gathered data that revealed a controversial finding: Code written by women was rejected much more frequently than code written by their male colleagues, according to people familiar with the matter and screenshots of internal discussions viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

For many female engineers at Facebook, the finding confirmed long-held suspicions that their coding faced more scrutiny than men's.

The results touched off a debate within Facebook over alleged gender bias among some of its most-valued employees: the engineers who build the features used by nearly two billion people every month. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about the findings during a weekly town hall meeting.

The outcry prompted senior Facebook officials to conduct their own review of the engineer's study. In an internal post published a month later, Jay Parikh, Facebook's head of infrastructure, attributed any gap in rejection rates to an engineer's rank, not gender. Many employees interpreted this new analysis as a sign that female engineers weren't rising at the same rate as men who joined the company around the same time.

Ms. Sandberg, recently described by Bloomberg as the "Oprah of corporate America," has been highly critical of society at large for allegedly discouraging the ambitions of women. But at the smaller society called Facebook, where she has held a senior leadership role for nearly a decade and by all accounts has exercised tremendous influence, women occupy few of the key roles. To be fair, Facebook isn't much different from the other Silicon Valley giants, as the Journal notes:

Like other major tech companies, including Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc., Facebook has struggled to increase the share of women and underrepresented minorities in its ranks.

The absence of women is particularly felt in engineering, which from college classrooms to the workplace has been seen as a man's field. Women account for 17% of technical roles at Facebook, according to its latest diversity report.

From everything we've been told, there is absolutely no shortage of highly sensitive progressives at the social-media giant, and yet the organization doesn't seem to be leaning in that far toward a more diverse workplace. There is of course an old-fashioned argument that an organization should simply seek to hire and promote employees based on the content of their character and their talent and forget about what people look like on the outside. And when it comes to gender there's an argument that men and women are different and may tend to have different preferences, regardless of what society tells them they should want. But those quaint views are endorsed by few large corporations in Silicon Valley or anywhere else.

So why do Facebook and Ms. Sandberg keep failing on their own terms? Perhaps the problem is her boss, Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but he seems just as committed as Ms. Sandberg to expressing liberal pieties.

Until there's an answer to the question of why Facebook isn't a Sandbergian model of corporate responsibility, this column has a suggestion: Before offering any more guidance to the rest of American business, the Facebook crew should first demonstrate how to reconcile its political agenda with the business demands of competitive technology markets.

David Asman : Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm David Asman , in this week for Paul Gigot, as we mark President Trump's first 100 days in office.

Now, by some standards, the administration has accomplished a great deal in that time, putting a justice on the Supreme Court, enacting massive deregulations, restarting the Keystone Pipeline project and a lot of other energy deals. And perhaps, most surprisingly, chalking up some foreign policy win. But it turns out, dealing with foreigners has proved easier than dealing with members of the U.S. Congress , with President Trump's legislative agenda stuck, until now. This week saw movement on new health care plan and a revolutionary simplification of our very complex tax code.

We start with this week's rollout of the tax plan, and not a moment too soon, with the U.S. economy growing just 0.7 percent in the first quarter of the year.

Joining the panel this week, "Wall Street Journal" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Washington columnist, Kim Strassel; editorial board member, Joe Rago; and assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman .

Well, Joe, let's talk about the tax plan because even though the press says there's not much to it, there's a lot to it. The details laid on Wednesday, business taxes for small and large companies cut down 15 percent, they are going to level the playing field between the big and the small by getting rid of a lot of the special deductions, a one-time tax to bring back $2 to $3 trillion in capital from overseas, very simplified individual tax rates from seven brackets down to three, lowering of the top marginal rate, getting rid of debt tax and alternative minimum tax, reduction of capital gains. It goes on and on. There's a lot of specific in here.

Joe Rago: Yeah, this is really an exercising in growth economics in that the reforms you're talking about are immediate permanent and enough to -- deep enough to improve the incentives. This is a plan designed to get us out of the 1 percent to 2 percent growth rut, which we've been in for so long, which is why wages aren't rising and businesses aren't investing and standards of living aren't going up.

Asman: Dan, the fact is that we tried this before, and most notably during Reagan years. The tax cuts during Reagan years did not kick until 1983. And if you look at a chart of growth rate from 1981 until the end of Reagan administration, look what happened. 1983, we went from a recession, negative 1.9 to 4.6 percent, and then at '84, we grew 7.3 percent, and from then on no lower than 3.5 percent.

Dan Henninger: Yeah, so we have to ask ourselves how did it happen. It isn't just magic. There's perhaps a tax policy that's built on magic. What Reagan did and what the Trump plan is trying to do is what we call a supply side tax reform as against the demand side, which is what basically Barack Obama did with his stimulus, which is you drop a lot of money into the economy, you give it to people, they spend it, the economy grows. We tried that for eight years with zero percent interest rates. It didn't work. This one is trying to liberate capital and put money in the hands of the producers. That lower corporate rate of 15 percent is going to apply as well to small and medium-sized businesses, and once that capital is retained by them, the ideas that they then will go out and invest it and create more jobs. That's the goal of this tax reform.

Asman: Of course, James, what the media says in describing this is this is break for the rich. In fact, you look at what happened to the Reagan administration, from '83 to '89, when the tax cuts kicked in until the end of the Reagan administration, yes, the rich increased their income by 12.2, but look at the poorest, the poorest 20 percent also had 12 percent gain.

James Freeman : Yeah, growth for everybody. Everybody is going to enjoy the growth. And I think the misconception is that people think that when you cut taxes on business only the owners of the business benefit. And what we have learned is it's not just that a company has more money and it can pay out more wages, but when it can get a better return on investment, it invests more. So when a business expands, puts in new equipment, new machinery, that's what allows people to be more productive and allows them to get higher wages. We have seen it in this country and all over the world. Lower business taxes, more productivity, people get paid more 36789.

Asman: Kimberly, what kills me about the Democratic criticism of this is it's going to add to the debt. Where have they been for the past eight years when our debt has grown from $10 trillion to $20 trillion? And that was by raising taxes, by the way. How dare they suggest or throw a stone at somebody else after what they have done?

Kim Strassel: You look at every single model out there, David, and it shows that the quickest way that you can deal with deficits and with debt is with a flourishing growing economy. That is the way that you end up having massive amounts of tax revenue come back to the federal government, when there are more people productively employed and more capital investment.

And so one of the things here that the Republicans are going to face as they deal with this is this criticism of deficit spending. And one thing that's notable and good this time around is you see Republicans pushing back on this and talking about the benefits of growth and the degree to what that growth could help pay for these tax cuts.

Asman: Hey, Joe, that's a very important point. Gary Cohan is the president's chief economic adviser. A lot of people say he came from Goldman Sachs , he was a Democrat, they didn't know he knew thinking about what Dan described in supply side economics but, in fact, when he was pressed on it on Wednesday, he said this plan will pay for itself. We will have enough growth, new economic activity, and enough elimination of those deductions and special deals, it will pay for itself. He didn't back down from that.

Rago: No, he didn't. I give him credit for getting to the supply side point. A lot of people were skeptical. I think Gary Cohn is sensitive about the tax-cuts-for-the-rich label. This is not a tax cut for the rich bill, this is a growth bill, and he deserves a lot of credit --

Asman: James, will it pay for itself, this bill?

Freeman: It will pay for a lot of the tax cuts. But we want to grow. As we say, if you have a bigger economy, you can pay for more government.

But just to underline, I think when a low or middle-income person, besides the from additional jobs, they are going to like what they see here where the standard deduction is doubled, 10 percent bottom rate, and we won't have as many as these taxes where you're essentially forced to hire a tax preparer. Simplicity means easy, cheap tax report filing. And so I think from that perspective, they are going to like what they say.

Asman: Here is what simplicity means, it's all in a postcard.

Freeman: Yeah.

Asman: They can put it in a postcard. Wouldn't that be nice after we went through with the tax season?

When we come back, the Trump tax plan facing a lot of hurdles on Capitol Hill as Democrats, even some Republicans, are voicing opposition. So can the president get a deal inside the Beltway, when we return?

Gary Cohn : This isn't going to be easy. Doing big things never is. We will be attacked from the left and we will be attacked from the right. But one thing is certain, I would never, ever bet against this president. He will get this done for the American people.

Asman: You're certainly going to be attacked from the left. This is the headline in "The New York Times " after it came out: "Tax overhaul would aid wealthiest." That, of course, who we just say, was top White House economic adviser, Gary Cohn , vowing this week that President Trump will get it done, and pushing cuts through Congress despite opposition of Democrats and even some Republicans.

Kim, how much does Washington and the nation's elite dislike what they heard this week?

Strassel: Well, Democrats hated what they heard this week because every aspect of this, other than perhaps some corporate tax reform, are ideas that are anathema to them, as we were discussing in the first segment. He's going to get no help from Democrats whatsoever. And one thing that was interesting about this proposal, and I think the smart thing about the proposal, was the acknowledgment that he wasn't going to get any cooperation. The president had been under a lot of pressure to not do tax reform, holistic tax reform, just go on the corporate side and try to bring some Democrats over with an infrastructure deal, but there was no guaranty that they would actually go along with that. So this bill was an acknowledgment that he is not going to get Democrat support. It was very much pitched at Republicans and Republican idea makers with the goal to getting this passed with Republican help.

Asman: Let me stick with your point, Kim, because some Republicans have also come out sounding like Democrats, saying, oh, he's going to add to the debt, et cetera. How does Trump nail them down?

Strassel: Look, I think that they're going to have to continue with this argument about the growth side of this bill, the importance of it from simply from a substantive point of view. We are as far as we are now into the middle of economic recovery. We saw those GDP numbers. If it doesn't get done, Republicans risk owning a recession, which would be terrible.

But he has to make a political point to them as well, especially in the aftermath of the problems with the health care bill. They have got to get a victory. And if there are some holdouts, that are on their own, as they did with health care, it will ruin this and stop Republicans from a win, they could own the loss of their congressional majority.

Asman: Dan, it's not only the politicians. It's the swamp creatures, the lobbyists from K Street, that are dead set against this, because they work all their lives to get these special deductions, and now they're at risk. Even somebody who is not going to be hurt by this, because they're going to keep the mortgage deductions, the Realtors Association came out against this bill, even though they continue to get what they've gotten before, mortgage deductions.

Henninger: Yeah, as we sometimes say, it's early days. The plan was just announced this week.

And, David, there is often a disconnect between the paid lobbyist in Washington whose reactions to something like that is knee-jerk, and the people they actually represent out there in the country. And I suggest a lot of the industries that are being represented by these lobbyists are going to call up and say, wait a minute, this looks pretty good to us.

I mean, every CEO you talk to and every business owner, if you could drop the corporate tax rate, the taxes I pay on my business, we will invest in the economy. I think that message is going to penetrate even the Beltway over the next several months.

Asman: James, if you give people a choice of what they have now - I mean, even the most-simple tax forms are more complicated than a postcard. At least you have a couple of pages. Most of us who pay our taxes actually have to go in and hire someone from H&R block.

Freeman: I think the simplicity is going to be very exciting, very compelling. But also, there's a big political winner if the White House can exploit it in this plan. And that is, finally, we are going to stop having people who live in low-tax states subsidize, to the tune of $100 billion a year, people who live in places like this, in New York, New Jersey and California. This may be why "The New York Times " is so upset about this thing.

Asman: Bingo.

Freeman: The truth is, Mr. Trump --

Asman: He's going to have to pay more in taxes.

Freeman: -- is going after a big subsidy for essentially rich people in New York and other places. And this could be a real gamechanger, not in terms of the federal tax code. If you stop rewarding state governments for overtaxing, you might see --

Asman: And, Joe, you stop rewarding rich people are getting their special cutaways. But what about the 45 percent of Americans who don't pay any federal income tax? I mean, that's a constituency that I would think the Democrats would be grabbing onto right now to object to this bill.

Rago: They do pay some taxes. They pay payroll taxes.

Asman: Well, yeah, exactly. And state taxes.

Rago: Right. They have moved off of the income roles. I don't think that is a particular potent force. It's much more the 90 percent of the state and local tax deductions for those who earn over 100 grand a year, those are the real things, the real considerations.

Asman: I want to get Kim in quickly.

Kim, what is the chance that the Trump team can steamroll over all this opposition?

Strassel: I think he has a better chance than with health care. This was something that a lot of Republicans wanted to go with first. Tax reform, there is a huge eagerness for it. He's got a better shot, a pretty good shot that he can get it done.

Asman: The last word from Washington.

When we come back, movement on another of President Trump's top priorities this week, repealing and replacing Obamacare. How close are GOP leaders to getting their bill across the finish line this time?

President Trump: I'm disappointed. I'll tell you, Paul Ryan is trying very, very hard. I think everybody is trying very hard. It is a very tough system.

Asman: President Trump on Friday, telling FOX's Martha McCallum that he's disappointed that Republicans aren't moving faster on one of his top priorities, repealing and replacing Obamacare. The conservative House Freedom Caucus announced its support for a revised bill this week, but it wasn't enough to put it across the finish line before the 100-day mark. The GOP leaders pushing the vote to next week at the earliest.

The action can't come soon enough for voters, 71 percent of whom say, in a new FOX News poll, that fixing the health care system is a higher priority than reforming the tax system.

So, Joe, what is different about this version?

Rago: There's a heightened sense of political urgency. Then you have a compromise that was constructed during the Easter recess between the conservative and the centrist factions within the Republican Party. What is would do is kind of set Obamacare's regulatory rules and so forth at the baseline, that states could obtain waivers to opt out of those rules if they chose to do so.

Asman: And, Dan, that seems to be enough for a lot of conservatives, right?

Henninger: For a lot of conservatives. But now the problem is the moderates, who are complaining that it doesn't do them much to protect people with pre-existing conditions.

David, we're getting to a point where you have to ask, what is the Republican Party for anyway? If they were elected and can't get their act together sufficient to do something like reform Obamacare, I think a lot of Independents out there are going to start saying, why do we support these people, why not go over the Democrats who know what they believe in and won't self-destruct over issues like this. I, for the life of me, do not understand why the Republican moderates can't get up the intellectual energy or inclination to go out and defend a compromise like this.

Asman: Kim, that leads me to wonder about Paul Ryan . He failed the first time. If he fails a second time, is he out as a figure, because he's supposed to corral these folks.

Strassel: I don't think he's out because, look, I think the bar for failure here is a little bit different. What we've seen is a process and it is proving long and messy. But all along it is achieving something. It is getting closer and closer.

What is noticeable about this is, yes, you have had a number of moderates come out and say they cannot support this version. That is tragic. And you will see pressure increase on them to get on board. But what is notable is there's some key members of that moderate group that have remained silent. They have not come out and said one thing or another. That suggests they are open, in fact, to coming on board in the end. And what you'll see over the next few days are continued negotiations, maybe a tweak here or there. But I'm hearing they are getting very close.

Again, it's taking longer than you might like, but I think what Paul Ryan 's message is, is we are just going to keep negotiating until we get to yes.

Asman: James, let's pull back for a second. There is still a fundamental disconnect between the plan, as far as it has gone, and the free market. You are still mandating that insurers do something that's against their own interest, ensure people who are going to cost more in benefits, those with pre-existing conditions, then they receive from premiums, the insurance companies. So there is still something un-market-like about what they're trying to do.

Freeman: Yeah. I mean, the government has spent decades making this not a market, so it will take a little bit of time. I think that's one thing that's made it difficult to get this process going. It's several steps. But the first step, cutting taxes by $1 trillion, cutting spending by $1 trillion, starting to reduce regulation. That was a great step last month. A little different version now where we're going to say, OK, some states can choose to have more of a market. Places like New York probably will choose to have less of a market. You can keep more of the regulations. That is kind of how our system ought to work.

Asman: Joe, there's another flaw with our system, as it is, which is there is a different between insurance and good health. You can have, as some people do, an insurance plan, what they call the Bronze Plan, and you still have a $12,000 dollar deductible. That means you have to pay out of pocket 12 grand before you get paid anything back, which means a lot of people aren't going to the doctor. They're putting off visits to the doctor. They are putting off tests, which could save their lives.

Rago: It is one of the big problems with Obamacare. It's creating distortions that you're talking about, giving people incentives not to get the care they need, to basically flee the market because they can't afford it. I think the reform plan that the House Republicans released will go a long way to resolving some of those in some of the states.

Asman: Dan, the key for a lot of people is getting rid of the middleman, whether the middleman is the government or an insurance company. Just put as little between the provider of health care and the recipient of health care, the patient, as possible, so, in some cases, you could just pull cash out of pocket and pay the doctor instead of having to go through any insurance program.

Henninger: That is exactly the goal. They are getting very close to it. It's inconceivable to me that the Republicans are going to hit President Trump with two setbacks on health care. But if that were to happen, I think the argument will then be made by the Democrats, why get involved in all this complication. Let's go to a universal health care system. And that's something that nobody wants. And that's what's at stake in this vote.

Asman: Guys, we've got to leave it at that.

Much more ahead as we assess the first 100 days of the Trump administration. The president already making his mark in the foreign policy arena amid a new provocation from North Korea. So is a Trump doctrine emerging? We're going to be asking General Jack Keane, coming up.

Asman: President Trump's first 100 days was not supposed to be notable for his expertise in foreign policy, and yet, the commander-in-chief has already chalked up military and diplomatic successes that have received praise, even from some Democrat rivals.

I spoke to retired four-star Army General Jack Keane a little earlier. He is the chair at the Institute for the Study of War and a FOX News military analyst.

General Keane, good to see you. Glad you could come here today.

Gen. Jack Keane: It's great to be here, David.

Asman: Have you, in the past 100 days, seen the development of a Trump doctrine in foreign policy and military policy?

Keane: Not specifically a doctrine. But I think what we're seeing are some good threads here. Number one, he's put America back on the world stage again. He's exercising leadership and promoting stability and security where the by-product is economic prosperity. And the decision making, what I see, is responsible, decisiveness and also has a moral underpinning to it.

And he's got two major anchor points. One is reassuring our allies. He has sent his government officials to the Far East, the Middle East, to Europe to make certain they all understand that the alliances of the past, we are back, we're going to back you up, we're going to be there for you. The second anchor point, and we've seen this, he is willing to confront his adversaries. And in a way that his predecessor was not.

Asman: Well, and in a way that shocked a lot of people, the most demonstrative point of that, I think, was the is Syrian attacks where we attacked the Syrian air base there. Were you surprised at that?

Keane: I was not -- I was surprised at the chemical attack, but I was not surprised by the response. I knew that the advisers around him would never let that stand. And he has got instincts himself about America, its role in the world, how you've got to be responsible. There's a moral issue here in using chemical weapons on your own people. It is a weapon of mass destruction. So he stood up for that --

Asman: And I don't think he ever said, I'm going to draw a red line, but he implied there would be a red line over which he wouldn't allow the Syrians to go. And unlike his predecessor, he didn't let them go beyond that. Once they crossed that red line, he reacted.

Keane: Yeah, I don't think he'll ever use the term "red line," but he's going to hold behavior of our adversaries to that.

And, look, at Iran. As soon as they violated the U.N . resolution on missile testing, he confronted them with sanctions. He put a military option on the table with the belligerence of Kim Jong-Un and his behavior. Obama never put that military option on the table. He said he had it in the beginning, but everybody knew he took it off the table.

Asman: You know, another thing that happened about the Syrian attacks with the Tomahawk missiles, it happened just when the Chinese president was here. And while they were having a big, beautiful chocolate cake, apparently, is when President Trump told the Chinese president about the missile attack. Did that help in any way to get the Chinese working harder in dislodging the North Korean threat?

Keane: Oh, absolutely, David. You put your finger right on it, yes. I think they knew instinctively that they were dealing with a different type of American president, and it began at that dinner because of what took place that night.

Asman: Do you think that was just a happy coincidence that --

Keane: No.

Asman: -- he happened to be there at the moment?

Keane: No, I think it was coincidental, but it's a gift that fell right into the president's lap, to be frank about it.

And, listen, the goodness out of that, for the first time in 20-plus years, the Chinese are working diplomatically to try to curb North Korea's behavior. And they -- both presidents have spoken a number of times on this. We believe that's major diplomatic breakthrough. I'm not sure it's going to turn into the kind of results we want. We'll see. The Chinese could be gaming us on this. I don't think so, but we'll have to see.

Asman: What about the military option, if there is an option, with North Korea? We have seen a show of force there, putting that nuclear sub in South Korea and this carrier task force that eventually made its way to the Korean coast. Is there any potential for military action?

Keane: Certainly, there are. We have three vectors that we're pursuing. One is the diplomatic option. We've, essentially, given the ball to China to take that. We're also reassuring our allies, South Korea and Japan, that we've got their back.

Economic options, I know the National Security Council is working on a number of sanctions dealing with North Korea. They'll be very tough by comparison in the past, and also possibly China, if China folds its hands and doesn't help.

And then the military options are there. What we would do with a military option is we would only use a military attack if we believe the North Koreans had weaponized a ballistic missile and they were about to fire it. That would provoke us. Otherwise, carrier battle groups can come and go, submarines can come and go, we are not going to take North Korea on in some kind of unprovoked attack. That will not happen.

Asman: Right. Let's bring it closer to home with Europe and Russia. Of course, Russia has a big strategist interest in what happened in Syria. That was kind of a shot across their bow as well. Now they have moved some of those Syrian planes to a Russian air base inside Syria. So there may be complications there. How do you see our relations with Russia working out in this new Trump environment?

Keane: Well, I really applaud the Trump team and the president on how they have handled Russia, because they have called out Russia. Tillerson did it at the press conference in Moscow --

Asman: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson .

Keane: -- with Lavrov sitting right next to him. He said the behavior and the relationship has never been as low as it is right now, and then he called them out for backing a criminal in Syria, right in front of Lavrov. Second, he said to him, he said the Minsk accord in Ukraine, where we had agreed that they would pull the separatist forces out and their military capability, Tillerson said this in front of Lavrov, he said, until such time that you do what you're supposed to do with the Minsk accord and pull your troops out from there, this relationship will never improve.

Asman: Wow.

Keane: And then he called them out for meddling in our election. So they've got Russia --

Asman: I'm going to mention a very minor point. He never smiled. You saw the big smiles of Hillary Clinton and President Obama in front of these guys. They knew they were taking him to the cleaners. Rex Tillerson has decades of experience dealing with these guys. He knows how to deal with them straight. That's a small point, but it shows how much experience he has in dealing with these guys.

Keane: Gone is the phony platitudes of John Kerry and the coddling of Lavrov that would always go on in public, even though Lavrov was always lying to us and certainly trying to cover up war crimes and this aggressive, assertive behavior. That's all over.

Asman: We've got to leave it but, General, do you feel safer now with Trump in office than you did with the previous administration?

Keane: Absolutely. Because all of our adversaries are reevaluating and assessing. And in a sense, he's got them a little bit back on their heels, and that's a good place to be.

Asman: General Jack Keane.

Good to see you, General.

Keane: Good to see you, David.

Asman: And still ahead, from a Supreme Court victory to a travel ban defeat, our panel weighing in on the highs and lows of the Trump administration's first 100 days.

President Trump: We're moving awfully well. We're getting a lot of things done. We are -- I don't think there's ever been anything like this. It's a false standard, 100 days, but I have to tell you, I don't think anybody has done what we've been able to do in 100 days, so we're very happy.

Asman: Well, he thinks it's great. President Trump on Friday touting the accomplishments of his first 100 days, but he's getting mixed reviews from the American public with just 45 percent of voters in a new FOX News poll approving of the job he's doing. But on some of the biggest issues facing the country, the president is scoring somewhat higher marks, including his handling of ISIS, terrorism and the economy.

We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, Joe Rago and James Freeman .

It's kind of, Dan, like the issues, he's doing well, but he doesn't get the credit for it, right? That's what the polls seem to show.

Henninger: They seem to show that, David. But let's stand back a little bit and try to figure out what we have learned about Donald Trump in the first hundred days. Came into the presidency without much political experience. He's been criticized for inconsistencies in his judgment, and certainly there's been a lot of lack of execution out of the White House. But to my mind, what we see here is a president who is actually being shaped by the forces inside American politics. And in the process, he is making judgments. And as I watch him, most of his judgments are on behalf of the private sector. And I think that's very important, because most of these executive orders are intended to help the job creators in the country, to get the private sector going. And to me, that's an enormous antidote to what we've had the last eight years, is that somebody actually understands how the economy works and is trying to move towards a system that allows that economy to function again.

Asman: But, Kim, in some cases, he is changing the status quo, not necessarily being influenced by it, but really changing it. I'm thinking of foreign policy. As General Keane was just saying, the whole leading from behind thing has changed completely. He's totally reversed that, hasn't he?

Strassel: Yeah, that is over. And also, he's done some things that, I think, have surprised people in positive ways, especially in foreign policy. Remember, there were great fears when this president was coming to office that this was an Isolationist after some of the talk about America First. In fact, you're seeing him out there not just leading on questions of foreign policy, but expanding his relationship with allies, asking new people to come into NATO , asking for help in some of these different adventures that he is tackling overseas. So I think he's surprised some people with regard to that. I think he's also just, look, domestically, surprised people in that he is doing exactly what he said he was going to do in terms of deregulation, tax cuts and a Supreme Court justice.

Asman: And, James, his appointments, and the Supreme Court justice, of course, was one of them. You look at Rex Tillerson , extraordinary guy. The defense secretary, the head of Homeland Security. He hired the general -- he's hired the perfect people for those positions, it seems to me.

Freeman: He's had some inspired choices. I would add Betsy DeVos at Education, Tom Price, Ben Carson. These are change agents in the government. And I think that's what we need. But until he gets his big tax cut signed, I think you got to mark him incomplete. On the plus side, as you mentioned, I think the big achievement of the first 100 days is Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. For people who want limited government, the rule of law, this really induced a state of euphoria, which I think may last for a while --

Asman: Of course, a lot of people voted on the basis of thinking about the Supreme Court. That's why a lot of people didn't vote for Hillary Clinton .

But, Joe, the question of legislative victory, he's had a lot of personal victories. He's appointed good people, the executive orders, some of them have been terrific in terms of getting the economy going. The market certainly believes so, having grown about 2,000 points on the Dow since he was elected. But he still hasn't had a legislative win, other than Gorsuch which, actually, was a legislative win, even though it was a simple majority.

Rago: Yeah. I think you have to put health care in the failure column for the first 100 days, although maybe there's reason for optimism next week. I guess the other weakness I would cite is just the way the president has used his credibility. It's a president's most valuable resource, and sort of picking dumb, pointless fights over inauguration --

Asman: I hope you're not talking about his Arnold Schwarzenegger criticism.

I thought he was right -- no, I'm kidding.

Rago: I actually thought that was hilarious.

A president needs credibility to make appeals to the public and to get things through Congress, and he's having so much trouble with Congress. in part. because he's been inconsistent.

Asman: Dan, what would be the brass ring, the motherlode over the next -- let's not do 100 days, but over the first term? If, for example, he gets a revolutionary new tax plan, like the one that was outlined this week, or if, in fact, it's clear that we can say ISIS has been defeated, something like that, what would be the motherlode issue for you?

Henninger: Well, undoubtedly, it would be the tax reform bill. We haven't had tax reform on that scale for 30 years. And you're talking about giving the economy an opening for, say, the next 15 or 20 years to simply go about the business of reviving itself. Later in the term, they might get around to reforming Dodd/Frank, getting all the sludge that was created inside the financial and the banking system. That's a big part of it. And as General Keane was suggesting, reassuring our allies the United States is going to be a global leader again rather than being back on its heels. That would be a big --

Asman: Kim, let me change the question just a little bit for inside-the- Beltway talk. What does he need to do over this first term in order for the GOP to win the midterm elections? Let's just say two years down the line, that's an important midterm election. What does he have to do between now and then?

Strassel: It's incredibly simple. He has to show that Republicans can lead and actually accomplish something. I mean, that's the important point about that health care failure and these questions of whether or not he gets tax reform, is that this is beyond the policy question. The voters this time said, look, we're unhappy with Democratic leadership in the White House and in the Senate and in the House when that was there, and we are going to give Republicans an unparalleled opportunity to run both of those branches of government and see what they can do. If they cannot perform, then that, you know, tryout is over, and they lose that interview, and things go back to the Democratic Party.

Asman: All right. Thank you, gang.

When we come back, two new reports that parents of college students can't afford to miss. Is that steep tuition you're now paying for your sons and daughters really worth it? Answers coming up.

Asman: Parents of college students getting a double dose of bad news this week with the Government Accountability Office reporting hundreds of thousands of people borrowed money under the Parent Plus Loan program have tumbled into default, exceeding the default rate of U.S. mortgages at the peak of the housing crisis. This, as another new study finding that college grads -- the ones parents are going into debt for -- are ill- prepared for the post-college job hunt and many of the most desirable entry-level positions.

James, it's hard to know which is worse, that college costs so much these days, and you're going in debt for it, or that it pays off so little.

Freeman: The answer is yes.

Freeman: Yes. You're screwed either way.

I'll give people the short answer that if your kid studies engineering, probably going to have an easier time getting a job than if they --

Asman: By the way, you have four kids that are about to go to college. You're going to be paying for college for the next 13 years.

Freeman: Yes.

Asman: This is real for you.

Freeman: Yeah. I've got to laugh so I won't cry. And you mentioned that comparison to the housing crisis., it's kind of amazing that we haven't had the same blame, recriminations about the people in the Washington who created this crisis. Thank god, the student loan market isn't as big as housing market. But in terms of recklessness, in terms of percentages defaulting, number of subprime borrowers, it's worse.

Asman: Right.

Freeman: And so I think, on the taxpayer end, it's probably even more painful for parents.

Asman: And, Dan, on the employment side, you look at a list of what employers want from college grads, and the college graduates have degrees in things that are not at all of interest to the employers. The employers want business and accounting, engineering, computer sciences, economics, etc. It's all Poli-Sci and anthropology, which is what they're graduating with degrees in.

Henninger: Yeah. Isn't it an irony, David, that for decades now these institutions, colleges and universities, going more and more liberal all the time, students pay them $40,000, $50,000, $65,000, the students sit in the classroom getting this politically correct trap pushed at them, and finally, they go, but I can't get a job with this stuff. In a way, it's kind of positive. The real world is impressing itself even on colleges and universities. You have to teach these people something useful, or they're not going to be employed in the real world.

Asman: Well, guess what? They're not getting useful stuff, Joe. Protesting Donald Trump is not a gainful means of employment.

Rago: No, you know, degrees in puppetry and --

Asman: Yeah.

Rago: -- cultural studies, pottery, whatever it might be, they're just not very valuable.

But it's interesting, if you look at the plot of where the most politically controversial colleges, they are all the most well off. They're the most affluent. When you go down the scale, there's no political problems there. And that's where they're learning actual technical skills, things employers want.

Asman: And, Kim, it's the folks behind you in the capitol that are partly responsible for this, and the White House, because they've been saying for years all you need is a college education, doesn't matter what you study, just get a college education, we'll give you the money, no matter how much in debt you end up being because of that. It's all been a lie. It's been a false promise.

Strassel: Well, they're responsible in so many ways, David, that we probably couldn't get through them all. But to go back to how you started this segment, the student loan program that is just shoveling money, taxpayer money out the door to all of these parents and students, which is what also allows the universities to then inflate their costs, and it ends up in this vicious cycle of ever higher costs and ever lower returns and ever more student debt. That's one of the things Washington has done.

Yes, this interminable message that you not have to the go to college, but to a four-year degree college, which is taking the focus off of vocational training, which is to important and high paying in many parts of this country. And, you know, the war that the Obama administration also waged on for-profit colleges, which are ones that, indeed, actually do turn out a lot of people that have very specialized skills in very important areas.

Asman: Yeah. And there's something wrong with that, according to a lot of people in Washington.

But, James, she brings up a great point, which is the fact that a lot of people have really placed their hopes on colleges who have been making out like bandits during all of this. I mean, it wasn't coincidental that Liz Warren was getting paid about $300,000 for teaching one course. So they're not doing badly at all. They've been sucking in, they've been the middleman, sucking in a lot of this government money, right?

Freeman: Yeah. If there's one sector that could really use market discipline, it's higher education. And you see it when you visit campuses. I've visit a lot of them in the last year. The money has gone everywhere. And --

Asman: My heart goes out to you, brother.

All right, thank you.

We have to take one more break. When we come back, "Hits Misses" of the week.

Asman: And it's time now for our "Hits Misses" of the week.

Kim, first to you. Go ahead

Strassel: David, this is a miss to Bill Nye , the TV personality who calls himself a Science Guy. He's got a new show out on Netflix . Mr. Nye is a climate alarmist. And in a show this week, he made the extraordinary suggestion that perhaps government should penalize parents who have extra children. It's not only an appalling statement, but it's an amazing insight into the increasingly extremist views a lot of these green groups, the degree to which they'll use climate as an excuse to regulate every aspect of American life.

Asman: And that worked out great in China, didn't it?

James, what do you have?

Freeman: David, we just spent a few minutes talking about the outrages on college campuses, but there's another thing that I wanted to bring up. This is a miss to my alma mater, Yale University , saying that it doesn't want alumni running to serve on its board of trustees to talk about issues like free speech on campus.

Really appalling. We need more discussion, especially from the people overseeing these institutions.

Asman: All right. Campuses not getting a break in this show.

What do you have for us, Joe?

Rago: David, a miss this week to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , who proposed an $85 billion budget for the coming year. That's up 21 percent since the time he took office.

Asman: That's three years. 21 percent rise in three years.

Rago: When Republicans talk about slowing the growth rate of spending by nowhere near 21 percent, for liberals, it's a huge crisis. Meals on Wheels, grandma's going to die on an ice flow. It would be much better to have some intellectual consistency.

Asman: And, of course, "The New York Times " said that Trump is terrible for this tax plan, but they didn't mention a word about Bill de Blasio .

Henninger: Well, David, I'm giving a big hit to Donald Trump who, this week, said he wanted to revisit the designation of national monuments. We're not talking about thing like Old Faithful, not monuments like that. What he's talking about is the fact that both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama set aside millions and millions of acres out west as national monuments, mainly to choke off natural resource development. Mr. Trump's goal is to give a lot of the authority back to the states, which is where it belongs.

Asman: Terrific stuff, gang. Thank you very much.

That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm David Asman . Catch me weekdays on "After the Bell" on the FOX Business Network at 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Paul is back next week. We hope to see you back here then.

Congressional Leaders Reach Deal to Fund Government Through Sept. 30; The package includes $2 billion more for the National Institutes of Health and leaves funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and Planned Parenthood largely intact

WASHINGTON—ongressional leaders have reached an agreement to fund the government through Sept. 30, congressional aides said late Sunday, as the two parties put aside some of their biggest spending fights in a bid to avert a government shutdown early in Donald Trump's presidency.

Details began leaking out late Sunday, with the legislation expected to be released later that night. Congress must pass a government funding measure before midnight Friday, when a partial shutdown will take effect unless Congress acts.

The package, which would fund the government through the end of the current fiscal year, includes a $12.5 billion increase in defense spending, a priority for Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans, but also a $2 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, despite Mr. Trump's request to cut funding for the institute, according to a senior congressional aide.

Another $2.5 billion in defense spending would be available if the Trump administration provided a plan to Congress to counter Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

The deal also includes $1.5 billion for border security, with the money to be spent on technology and on repairing existing infrastructure, the aide said.

But the package says explicitly that the money can't be used to pay for the construction of the new border wall that Mr. Trump has made a signature project, a blow to the White House. The agreement also leaves largely intact funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and protects the women's health provider Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. from spending cuts, the aide said.

The package comes after Congress passed a one-week measure last week to buy time to hammer out a more complete deal. While in past years Congress has been able to work through differences and keep the government running, anxiety has been heightened since 2013, when conservatives triggered a government shutdown in an ill-fated attempt to block the Affordable Care Act from going into effect.

Those jitters could intensify as Congress turns its attention to the next spending bill, which will cover the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The Trump administration has proposed a budget that calls for sharp cuts to spending on foreign aid, environmental protection and public broadcasting, and the White House has shown no signs of backing down from some of its proposals.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is floating a plan to slash 2,300 jobs and 26% of the budget from the State Department, affirming the Trump administration's intention to favor military over diplomatic spending, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.

World News -- Middle East Crossroads: Israel's New Neighbor:  ISIS

ELIAD, Golan Heights -- On one side of a fence that snakes through eucalyptus-covered ridges is a swath of Syrian villages held by Islamic State. On the other, Yitzhak Ribak grows his Merlots, Cabernet Sauvignons and Syrahs.

"My grapes are just 10 meters from the border fence. Sometimes I hear the booms on the other side. Sometimes I see people on the other side. They look like shepherds, but who knows," said the Israeli winemaker. "It's crazy."

So far, Islamic State hasn't bothered his vineyard. "I am here all alone on my tractor at night and I am not afraid."

While most attention has focused on Islamic State's shrinking but still vast territory in eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq, the extremist group has also proved resilient in the pocket of land it controls at the confluence of Syria, Jordan and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.

Known as the Khalid bin Walid Army, the Islamic State affiliate has rebuffed repeated offensives by the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and other moderate rebels. The porous nature of Syria's front lines and corruption within FSA ranks have allowed Islamic State personnel and weapons to infiltrate the area known as the Yarmouk Basin, said Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a security analyst who follows the group.

The presence of Islamic State so close to Israeli-populated towns and villages along the demarcation line in the Golan Heights poses an obvious threat -- albeit one that so far hasn't materialized into cross-border attacks.

"The Golan is still the quietest place in the whole country," said Yoni Hirsch, chairman of the municipal council of Nov, a community of some 800 people about 2 miles from Islamic State-held areas. But, he said, "we know that in one day with the decision of one person on the other side, our lives can change."

The Israeli government is taking no chances. Over the past three years, it has replaced the old security fence in the Golan Heights, a plateau seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, with a new structure some 20 feet high and equipped with modern sensors. It is also erecting a new fence further south along the border with Jordan.

Islamic State has pledged to eliminate Israel as part of its plan to build a world-wide Islamic caliphate. But it also has priorities and in southern Syria, the militants have focused on fighting more moderate rebels.

Such an unexpectedly peaceful coexistence with Islamic State next door helps explain Israeli perceptions of the Syrian conflict. The U.S. and European allies view Islamic State, which has carried out terrorist attacks in the West, as the principal threat.

Israeli officials, by contrast, are far more alarmed by Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia. Preventing Iranian proxies from getting close to the Golan has emerged as a key Israeli priority in the Syrian conflict.

Islamic State, also known by its Arabic acronym Daesh, "is not powerful enough to make us fear," said Ayoob Kara, the only Arab minister in the Israeli government who says he is in regular contact with Syrian factions.

"Daesh is going to lose," he added. "There is no way it is going to be successful and by the end of the year, we won't see it in any state around here. The problem of the Middle East is the capital of extremism that is Iran."

For Mr. Ribak, who moved to Eliad in 1973 a few months before Syrian tanks attempting to recapture the Golan were stopped outside the village, the growth of Islamic State across the fence carries a clear message. Israel was lucky, he said, that its lengthy attempts at peace talks with Syria, based on trading the Golan Heights for a peace treaty, finally collapsed in 2010.

"If we had given the Golan to Syria then, it would have all become ISIS-land," Mr. Ribak said.

Two U.S. Army service members were killed and a third wounded during a late-night operation in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said Thursday, following the death of an American soldier there this month.

The U.S. military has escalated its engagement in the country since the Trump administration took office in January, increasing airstrikes against the Taliban and Islamic State and more frequently sending out soldiers on operations with their Afghan counterparts.

An official with the international military coalition in the country said the soldiers were Army Rangers. The two were killed during an operation against ISIS Khorasan, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said, referring to Islamic State's affiliate in the country.

The latest deaths come as the White House debates the military's request for more troops to fight resurgent Taliban and Islamic State threats in Afghanistan.

Two U.S. Army service members were killed and another wounded during a late-night operation in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said on Thursday, following the death of an American soldier there this month.

The U.S. military has escalated its engagement in the country since the Trump administration took office in January, increasing airstrikes against the Taliban and Islamic State and more frequently sending out soldiers on operations with their Afghan counterparts.

Further details surrounding their deaths weren't known. An official with the international military coalition in the country said the soldiers were Army Rangers.

The two "were killed in action last night in southern Nangarhar, Afghanistan, during an operation against ISIS Khorasan," Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said, referring to Islamic State's affiliate in the country. "Their identities, service, and unit affiliations are being withheld pending next-of-kin notification."

The latest deaths come as the White House debates the U.S. military's request for more troops to fight resurgent Taliban and Islamic State threats in Afghanistan.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was in the capital Kabul on Monday to discuss the troop request. A number of the Afghan military's top officials, including defense minister Abdullah Habibi and army chief of staff Qadam Shah Shahim, resigned that day in the wake of the deadliest Taliban attack since 2001.

Taliban militants toting machine guns and explosives had on April 21 gained access to the Afghan army's northern headquarters, massacring at least 170 of its soldiers. The government admitted the scale of the disaster only after details were leaked to the media over the weekend.

The Afghan government has denied allegations by critics, including coalition officials, that its military is in a state of disarray on the cusp of the Taliban's annual spring offensive -- when fighting and attacks usually increase. Afghan officials called Monday's resignations part of a continuing reform program.

President Donald Trump's administration has yet to announce an official policy for Afghanistan, but Afghan officials and their coalition counterparts widely expect him to send more troops to the country, which has been at war for almost four decades.

Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, this month took advantage of the U.S. military's greater freedom in the country to drop the U.S.'s second-largest nonnuclear weapon on Islamic State fighters in its east, the first time the munition has ever been used in combat.

Afghan officials claim the strike killed scores of fighters. But coalition officials say it may have been ineffective, as the area remains insecure and fighting continues around the site.

The Two Faces of Qatar, a Dubious Mideast Ally

By Charles Wald and Michael Makovsky 
634 words
25 April 2017

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited several of America's Middle Eastern partners last week -- including a dubious one. Qatar hosts an important air base but also undermines American security by sponsoring Islamic radicalism.

Nearly all coalition airstrikes against Islamic State are commanded from America's nerve center at Qatar's al-Udeid Air Base, which also supports missions in Afghanistan. The U.S. Air Force stations many of its larger aircraft there -- refueling tankers, advanced surveillance and early-warning aircraft, and heavy bombers. Al-Udeid also houses the Combined Air and Space Operations Center, which commands all coalition air operations in the region. With all these key assets in one place, the Pentagon expects to stay through 2024.

But the host nation supports some of the groups the base is used to bomb. According to the State Department, "entities and individuals within Qatar continue to serve as a source of financial support for terrorist and violent extremist groups," including al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. Qatar has also supplied advanced weaponry to militants in Syria and Libya.

Doha poured billions into the radical Muslim Brotherhood government of former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, who urged supporters "to nurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred for them: for Zionists, for Jews." The Brotherhood's supreme guide, Mohammed Badie, has called jihad against Israel and America "a commandment of Allah that cannot be disregarded."

After Mr. Morsi's government fell in 2013, Qatar offered safe harbor to many Brotherhood leaders. Pressure from neighbors eventually forced Doha to eject them, but Qatar still hosts Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a Brotherhood-affiliated preacher who once declared, "Those killed fighting the American forces are martyrs." Qatar is also a key financier of Hamas, a Palestinian spinoff of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has repeatedly attacked Israel with rockets.

Qatar wields tremendous soft power on behalf of radical Islam through its state-funded Al Jazeera news channel. Mr. Qaradawi has a weekly show, and the network became notorious in America for broadcasting Osama bin Laden's videos, repeatedly and uncut, far exceeding their news value.

Given President Trump's forthright opposition to radical Islamic terrorism, it makes sense to ask whether the U.S. should continue leasing crucial military assets from a government that supports such ideology. If Qatar won't change its behavior, the U.S. should consider relocating assets from the base. The United Arab Emirates would be a logical destination. It is an active partner in American efforts to combat ISIS, pacify Afghanistan and counter Iran. U.S. officials consider the U.A.E. one of their strongest Arab partners. Mr. Mattis has called it "Little Sparta."

Emirati air bases could accommodate U.S.-led operations currently run from al-Udeid, without putting U.S. aircraft farther from their targets. The Combined Air and Space Operations Center would need to be replaced, but the cost would be easily outweighed by the security benefits. The U.A.E. is a far more responsible actor than Qatar, and it already works with the U.S. military to train pilots from our other Gulf allies and coordinate coalition air operations.

If the Trump White House hopes to end the free-riding of American allies, it can start by sending a clear message to Doha: The benefits of al-Udeid do not outweigh Qatar's support for extremism.

Rex Tillerson : Iran is the world's leading state- sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intense fighting in multiple contacts and undermining U.S. interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. They are continuing to support attacks against Israel. An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.

Paul Gigot: Welcome to "The Journal Editorial Report." I'm Paul Gigot.

"Another North Korea in the making" - that was Secretary of State Rex Tillerson yesterday announcing that the Trump administration will conduct a comprehensive review of its policy towards Iran, warning that leaving the country unchecked would lead to greater threats around the world.

John Bolton is the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a Fox News contributor.

Ambassador, welcome back to the program.

John Bolton : Glad to be with you.

Gigot: So, as a look at the first few weeks of the Trump administration foreign policy, it looks like there is really concerted focus on what I would call the countries that use or are trying to get weapons of mass destruction. Syria, we say the chemicals launched. North Korea, we've seen a concerted effort to contain that. Now Iran. Is that a fair summary of where they're putting their emphasis?

Bolton: I think that's accurate. I think that reflects where the president himself is deeply concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In the case of the Syrian regime and the use of chemical weapons to actually use military force in response. If you put it all together, it's a very anti-proliferation administration.

Gigot: That ought to be the focus, do you think? I mean, should that be our top foreign policy focus now?

Bolton: Coupled with the obvious priority of destroying ISIS, the president has called for new plans from the Pentagon on that score, and I think it goes along with the widely held view, at least in Republican circles, that proliferation and terrorism are the two most urgent threats we face around the world.

Gigot: OK. Let's talk first about North Korea. The president's strategy seems to be to say, you are -- the strategic patience is over so we're not going to anymore give you just the time you want to get the weapons you want. Also, to engage China in a more aggressive way, and say to China we will give you a better deal on economic access and trade, but you, in return, have to do something about North Korea. Is that a strategy that you favor? It's different than what the Bush and Obama administrations did.

Bolton: It's definitely different. It's definitely an improvement. But I don't think it's sufficient. China has, for 25 years, talked one way about nuclear weapons and acted a different way. It says it doesn't want North Korea to have a deliverable nuclear weapons capability but it's never exerted the pressure that it could. So getting China to say, yes, we will do more is something that has been tried in the past. It hasn't worked.

I think the problem here is North Korea will never voluntarily relinquish its nuclear weapons program and, in effect, in their mind, it's equivalent to the regime itself.

Gigot: Right.

Bolton: So looking at the bigger picture, I think it is really the end of North Korea that is required to get the end of their nuclear weapons program. That means getting China on board for reunification. I think what President Trump has done could be a step in that direction, could be a step and try and bridge that gap but he is not there yet.

Gigot: I don't see any sign that the Chinese government is anywhere close to that kind of recognition that they're willing to accept a unified Korea. Their fear is that they will get a unified Korea, through Seoul, with Western troops at the border of China. They don't want that. Even if the U.S. said, if you can unify it, we won't move our troops anywhere, they still are unwilling to take that step. How do you get China to make that recognition? Do you have to have Japan go nuclear first to be able to scare them enough to make a change?

Bolton: That would certainly scare them. I think what you have said about the attitude of many in the top Chinese leadership is unquestionably true. It's reflecting Mao Tse Tung's rather unappetizing metaphor that the two Communist Parties are as close as lips and teeth. But we've seen in the past week, the leading Chinese historian of the Korean War basically call for a complete transformation of China's policy. They see -- he and many others see North Korea as a pretty ugly piece of baggage. I don't underestimate the difficulty of this negotiation. I wish we had started 10 years ago. Right now, North Korea and the progress towards being able to hit targets on the west coast of the United States with an ICBM, first raised by the commander of U.S. forces created last year, now I think it's widely accepted by analysts across the political spectrum, that has added a new urgency to this. And when Donald Trump says to Xi Jinping , as he apparently did, either you fix this or we will fix it by ourselves, you are risking military conflict on the Korean peninsula, which will bring all the things that China fears. So they could do it the hard way or they can do it the someway easier way. It's really up to them.

Gigot: Let's turn to Iran. You saw Tillerson ratchet up the pressure on Iran. Yet, the U.S. is still saying it will continue to be part of the Iran nuclear deal. And the State Department said Iran is honoring that agreement. Do you agree that they are honoring that agreement?

Bolton: Absolutely, not. That certification was an embarrassment to the administration. Iran has violated the parts of the deal reflected in the Security Council resolution adopted in 2015. They have exceeded the enriched uranium limits. They've exceeded the heavy water limits. They've barred IAEA inspectors from key military installations. And on the ballistic missile front, they are way, way out of compliance. So it was a step in the right direction for Secretary Tillerson to say at least we are reviewing the thing but the president has basically said they're not living up to the spirit of the agreement. I don't think Iran is living up to the letter of the agreement either. The sooner we ditch it and make clear political statements that their behavior is unacceptable not just on terrorism but on the nuclear front, too, the better.

Gigot: So you would get out of it in the next few months if you were the Trump administration.

Bolton: About 100 days ago, I would have gotten out of it.

Gigot: I don't think they can do that. I think they are afraid the allies will just say we're not going to go with you on new sanctions, and the political cost of that is too high. I think they will put pressure militarily on expansion on Iran but not pull out of the deal. Do you agree with that?

Bolton: It could be that they see the political risk is too high. Honestly, unless you lead the allies, they will not follow. Too many European companies are trying to get invested in Iran. I think every day that goes by makes it more difficult to get out of this disastrous deal.

Gigot: All right. Thank you, Ambassador Bolton. Appreciate it.

Bolton: Thank you.

Gigot: Still ahead, The Trump Doctrine: From North Korea to Iran, the administration said the era of strategic patience is over. So what will take its place? Our panel weighs in, next.

Vice President Mike Pence : The United States of America well always seek peace. And under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready.

Gigot: Vice President Mike Pence aboard the "USS Ronald Reagan" in Japan on Wednesday warning North Korea not to test the resolve of the American military and promising an overwhelming and effective response to any use of conventional or nuclear weapons. The administration making clear in recent weeks that the era of so-called strategic patience is over. So what does that mean for American foreign-policy?

Let's ask "Wall Street Journal" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Washington columnist, Kim Strassel; and columnist, Bill McGurn.

So, Bill, what have we learned these last two weeks, do you think, about the Trump foreign policy>

Bill McGurn: As you said before, there will be no coherence ideology like a Trump Doctrine.

Gigot: There's no such thing.

McGurn: What we learned is not the America First of the 1930s, the isolationist kind of policy, you know, Charles Lindbergh, when they wanted to bomb Syria.

Gigot: Right.

McGurn: Right? So we learned that. We also learned that Donald Trump definitely is comfortable with the use of American force and rejects the idea that the only choice the president has is a full-scale U.S. invasion with U.S. troops and doing nothing. So within that, there's a lot of grounds in there on what he can do.

Gigot: Yeah. The word of choice that some people have, Jacksonian, after Andrew Jackson, a muscular nationalism, but wary of too much foreign entanglement.

I know it's early but does that sound right.

Dan Henninger: I don't know, Paul. Reaching back into the 1830s strikes me as kind of a stretch on American foreign policy for 2017. If the era of strategic patience is over, I suggest what we're entering into is the era strategic impatients. Donald Trump is an impatient man. Whereas, Barack Obama used to lean back on most issues, so- called leaning from behind, Donald Trump 's inclination is to lean in. That's clearly what he has been doing in the Middle East and Asia. The question is, what policy comes along with that. My impression is it harkens back maybe to the Reagan years, in 1988, strategic doctrine, in which we said we will work with our allies and use all the elements of American power, we would not seek work, but we would try to prevent domination of America's interests by any particular power.

Gigot: But let me push back on that. What I recall from the '80s with Reagan was extremely patient. It set up a policy that said we're going to contest the Soviet Union across the board, we're going to call it what it is, an evil empire, we're going to try to undermine politically and internally. But we're not going to rush to any engagement overseas. We'll be very cautious on that. But he was very patient.

Henninger: He wasn't so patient in Grenada.

Gigot: Well, Grenada isn't North Korea.

Henninger: Yeah, sure. But he acted when he had to act. In Syria, I wouldn't compare Syria to Grenada, but Syria, he was taking a limited action for the purposes of showing the allies in the region that we are going to be there. And I think a political strategy will follow the strike on Syria, same as is happening over in Korea.

Gigot: One of the things that we've seen, Kim, is that alliances are back in vogue in a way they weren't during the Trump campaign. I mean, he's now -- he said NATO was obsolete. Now he says, well, it's not obsolete. He was cautious about the alliance with South Korea and Japan. Now is he is putting both arms behind Japan and South Korea.

Kim Strassel: Yeah. This is important, and it falls on what Bill said, that this is not the isolationism that a lot of people feared. He has not only put his arms around NATO , he has invited Montenegro to join. He is expanding alliances rather than diminishing them. Because I think that there is an understanding in the senior leadership and the top administration that if you are going to be forceful and take these actions, that you do so even more effectively when you have big allies behind you and you could rally the world. We've seen that with Nikki Haley, his ambassador to the United Nations, very much attempting to reach across and get various like-minded people to push back along with the Trump administration and make a statement globally about some of these rogue actors.

Gigot: All right. Bill, I want to ask you about this episode last week with the "USS Carl Vinson," the carrier group, where the White House and President Trump said, we are sending in armada to the North Korean peninsula, and the Pentagon suggested the same, and we find out it's actually down --

Gigot: About a half a world away in the Indian Ocean. This had a bad reaction in South Korea.

McGurn: Yeah.

Gigot: They said, look, can we trust you or not? You don't want to say your force is there and it's not.

McGurn: It's just an embarrassment. Somewhere, the message got mixed. But it was a good idea to send a carrier group to North Korea, and they should have done it.

I think the thing about Donald Trump is he has said a lot of contradictory things over the course of the campaign, and some of them you just can't square. He was down with NATO before and now Montenegro. I don't think he would have had the rhetoric that supported the Syria strike in the campaign. But it does show he's willing to learn. And some people get that once he got in office and saw the complexity, he would realize, for example, that Vladimir Putin was an obstacle to a lot of the things that he would want to do. So we're going to have to -- I keep saying it's kind of like Nancy Pelosi and the health care bill, we're going to have to let Trump carry out his foreign-policy to find out what it is.

Gigot: But that's dangerous, potentially, is it not, if the rest of the world is trying to wait and figure out, OK, what's going to come down on this one?

McGurn: Except they think they now have to think when the American president will act, which they did not have for eight years.

Henninger: Well, that's how the Japanese reacted. It was interesting that, yes, the Koreans were upset, but the Japanese government spokesman was asked directly about the armada incident, and he declined to comment on that. All he said was, we are happy that the United States is now putting all options on the table. That's a step forward for the Japanese and their attitude towards these sorts of things. I think they are focused on the main issue in Asia.

Gigot: All right. When we come back, Republicans narrowly avoid an embarrassing defeat as the Democrats come up short in a special election in Georgia. But is it a warning for the GOP heading into the 2018 midterms?

Gigot: Democrats came up short Tuesday on the special election to fill the Georgia House seat once held by HHS Secretary Tom Price, with Democrat Jon Ossoff narrowly missing the 50 percent threshold needed to win the race outright. He will now face Karen Handel, the top Republican vote getter, in a June runoff.

We are back with Dan Henninger and Kim Strassel. And "Wall Street Journal" assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman , also joins the panel.

Kim, you wrote this week that you thought Democrats were finally getting their act together with this Georgia race. How so?

Strassel: For eight years under Barack Obama , the Democrats had had this very arrogant approach in which they just believed that their progressive values would resonate across the country and you saw the result, which was they lost the House and the Senate and any number of seats at the local level. So what you saw down in Georgia this week was a Democratic Party that determined they were going to run a candidate that fit the district and had a shot at winning. This was a guy who bragged about his national security credentials. He talked about cutting taxes for small businesses. He was a fan of cutting waste and corruption in Washington. Now he also held a lot of progressive views and that's probably why he won't win this district in the end. But a lot closer to the smart Democratic policy of old of trying to actually run candidates who can win.

Gigot: And the Democratic Party nationally poured an enormous amount of money in this and you're saying they were willing to give him a pass on some of these other issues because they realize they want to paste a defeat on the Republicans and the Trump administration, and you need to pick up a seat here at the margin in these kind of swing districts, suburban districts, if you're going to take back the House. Are we seeing a new pragmatism on the part of the Democrats here, or is this just a one off?

Strassel: It is, and not just among the Democratic leadership. You had groups like the Daily Koss, which is a far-left progressive organization, supporting these guy, despite his views on tax cuts, and his views on national security, because they have come to understand and they actually said, unless we have a Democratic majority again in Congress, we can achieve any of our priorities.

Gigot: It's really interesting, Dan, because you would think that -- the Republicans here have a split field, 11 candidates, or something like that. None of them could really build any momentum. Nonetheless, they still managed to hold off, by 50 percent. But you would think -- there was a lot of chortling among Republicans. The left is going to challenge the primary run against anybody who goes it all to the center. Maybe that's not the case. And this looks to me like a little bit like the 2006 strategy where the Democrats took back the House by Rahm Emanuel , who was then in the House, picking candidates who were more appropriate to the swing districts.

Henninger: Yeah. I guess one questions is, though, how appropriate are those candidates to the national party or what they might do when they're in Congress. There was nothing vaguely right of center about Barack Obama's presidency.

Gigot: That's true, but if the local voters say this guy is a reasonable guy, yeah, Pelosi, we'll worry about that later, but he seems fair. And if the Republicans are not enthusiastic, you could see them turning up, particularly in these suburban areas.

Henninger: In those suburban areas. It's very important and isn't talked about enough. Look, Ossoff, in some respects, was a progressive Libertarian. He's left of center on social issues and he's right of center on economic issues. And there is a sense I think in which in these suburban counties the culture is, in some sense, moving leftward on issues like women, gender, race relations and so forth, at least the way the progressives define it. So the Republicans I think have got to get some momentum back and start focusing on those counties and address the phenomenon we just saw in that Atlanta district.

Gigot: Yeah, particularly when it comes to these districts where you have college educated Republicans, who aren't in love with Trump. And Trump only won this district narrowly.

James Freeman : Yeah. So I think the Democrats probably -- this is positive because what they're doing is they're focusing on how to we assemble a winning coalition versus spending their time blaming fake news, the Electoral College, Russia, misogyny, whatever else they want to ascribe last fall to. They are now, I think, looking forward a little, how do we rebrand ourselves. But I think they will find, voters in this district will find that Ossoff is really not all that moderate, even on economics. So I think what they've got to do is move back towards candidates in swing districts who are actually moderate not just projecting a moderate image.

Gigot: How do you feel about this runoff in June, Kim? And throw in Montana, where you have another special election coming up.

Strassel: It is going to be tough for Democrats to win this district. As you said, the Republicans split it between 11 candidates. Karen Handel, the Republican nominee, is very quickly gathering and uniting support among Republicans. They had to spent $8 million just to get off where he was. You can ask whether it would've been smarter for them always to put a lot more attention into Montana and the special election coming up because that is a state that has historically --

Gigot: Elected Democrats.

Strassel: -- elected Democrats, right. So if they were in a place their bets somewhere, that might be a big shot. You'll see them move a lot of resources to that state now.

Gigot: You think they are going to compete there as well? They really do need, for all --

Strassel: They want to victory.

Gigot: They need a victory here to show Republicans, and scare Republicans from actually taking difficult votes in Congress.

Strassel: Yeah, absolutely. They want to send a message that there is some sort of backlash to Trump, that the voters have already turned against him. None of these special elections necessarily would say that, regardless of the outcomes. They really do turn more often on local issues, et cetera. But they believe if they can notch up a win that they can suggest that the tide has turned against Donald Trump , and Republicans must beware.

Gigot: All right. Still ahead, Republicans scramble as their deadline for tax reform slips. Economist Art Laffer joins us with some advice for the GOP.

President Trump: We are in very good shape on tax reform. We have the concept of the plan. We will be announcing it very soon. But health care -- we have to get the health care taking care of. And as soon as health care takes care of, we are going to march very quickly. You're going to watch. We're going to surprise you.

Gigot: President Trump on Tuesday sounding an optimistic note on tax reform just a day after his Treasury secretary walked back expectations for how quickly an overhaul would happen. Steve Mnuchin , who initially set an August goal for casting a bill, told the "Financial Times " this week that a summer deadline is, quote, "highly aggressive to not realistic at this point."

My next guest has some advice from the administration as it struggles to move forward with a plan, keep it simple.

Economist Art Laffer is the co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. He advised the Trump presidential campaign on economic policy.

Good to see you again, Arthur.

Art Laffer: Thank you, Paul. Good to see you.

Gigot: All right. I want to ask about the economy and where we are first, before we get to tax reform. A lot of signs of weakness in the quarter, maybe extending into the second. Are we in slow growth right here?

Laffer: Well, in the very short term, but, yes, we are. We are in a slow period. But in the long term, we're in the worst possible economic condition we've have in 67 years. The economy, if you look at real GDP, we are the lowest point in 67 years, Paul. It's a horrible economy. We really need something to get this thing going and bring us back up to the norms we had in the '60s, 70s and '80s.

Gigot: All right. I think you think tax reform it part of that agenda. So --

Laffer: It sure is.

Gigot: OK. But what about this timing, the delay on this. When people, businesses think there is going to be a tax cut around the corner, they tend not to invest right now.

Laffer: That's true. That's the big mistake we made under Reagan was we deferred the tax cuts. If you know they're going to cut taxes the next year, what do you do this year. You defer all the income you possibly can to next year, and that's why we had the '81, '92 deep, deep, deep recession, was because of the deferred taxes. They shouldn't make that mistake. Big tax reform, the mega tax reform that they're talking about takes time and it does take a lot of time. But we could do one thing right away. We could cut that corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent just right away to get the economy jump-started. So that's what I think they should do. So --

Laffer: -- you get that corporate rate down, everyone wants it.

Gigot: So Democrats support it, in theory. Republicans support it.

Laffer: Yeah, they do.

Gigot: So basically, do that corporate tax reform. But how do you get Democratic votes for something like that when, right now, there's so much hostility to the Trump administration? I mean, you've got to get 60 votes for what you're talking about in the Senate.

Laffer: I don't know about the Senate. But I do know there are a lot of Democrats now who really want to do tax reform. I did one for Jared Polis (ph) and Darrell Issa quite a while ago that would've been a radical tax reform on corporate taxes. So there is a lot of support in the House for this, and I believe in the Senate, too, Paul. I'm not an expert on counting votes.

Gigot: Right.

Laffer: But when you look at this, it would raise revenue dramatically. And the only reason the president wants to do health care first is because of this silly, silly notion of pay-for, where you have to find something to cut taxes, if you're going to raise them. It's just ridiculous. And I don't know who is giving him that advice. But honestly, if we had had pay- for in the 1920s, we never would've have the Roaring '20s. We never would have had the go-go '60s. And goodness knows, we would not had have the Reagan Revolution in '80s.

Gigot: OK, so you're saying that revenue neutrality, just forget about that. Let's just cut the rate. You'll get a lot more revenue than you think coming back anyways so --

Laffer: Oh, definitely.

Gigot: -- don't worry about it. And that will take care of itself over time as the economy ratchets up the growth rate.

Laffer: That's right. Yeah, you want to have revenue neutrality with tax cuts this year and revenue three years from now. That is the way you want to do it. You don't want to cut welfare programs when the economy is in bad shape like this to pay for a tax cut. Frankly, this is a time, Paul, that people need welfare payments because they are having hard times. Once you get the economy growing, then you can cut the welfare programs because people have good high-paying jobs. But right now, you need to be warm hearted as well as clear-eyed.

Gigot: How low do you think the corporate tax rate has to go? It's 35 percent now. Does it have to go all the way to 15 or can you settle for 20? Would that be enough?

Laffer: I think it's a continuum. Obviously, 20 is better than 35. 15 is better than 20. What I would really love to see is the corporate tax rate reform where we're not taxing profitable companies and subsidizing unprofitable ones. I'd would love to see, like, a Value-Added Tax for corporations and get rid of the corporate tax all together. But that, notwithstanding, I would love to see it go as low as possible.

Gigot: Here's the other question. I know that a lot of House Republicans, like Speaker Paul Ryan , are worried about this. If you do corporate tax reform first, you are leaving the individual taxpayer behind, and maybe even the small business taxpayer behind. Why should the poor wage slave pay 40 percent when somebody who is in business is only going to pay 15?

Laffer: Because his wage will be doubled.

That's why he pays 40 percent. Or he's going to have a job rather than being unemployed. The whole key here is the people who don't pay taxes because they have no income are not really benefited by our tax code, if I may be so frank. And you cannot balance the budget, Paul, on the backs of the unemployed or people who leave your jurisdiction. It just doesn't happen that way.

Gigot: But, Arthur, will you concede that if you do corporate tax reform first, you may never get the kind of individual tax rate reductions that you and I would both like to see because, politically, it becomes much harder if you don't attach it to something that, for example, the Democrats want. They Democrats don't want individual rates cut.

Laffer: That's true. They have been arguing -- they did that like in the 80s as well. When we did our ultimate tax reform, Paul, in the '80s, it wasn't until 1986, six years into Reagan's presidency, before we were finally able to bring the Democrats together because of the prosperity we created. All of the Democrats joined with us in 1986 to support the '86 Tax Act, which dropped the highest rate, if you'll remember, from 50 percent down to 28 percent. It cut the corporate rate from 46 to 34 percent. And it got rid of all of these deductions and exemptions and seclusions and favor grabbings and had it revenue neutral. It was the best tax bill ever and it passed in the Senate, 97 to three.

Gigot: All right.

Laffer: That will happen now. Once Trump gets the prosperity going, the Democrats will flock to our side, Paul.

Gigot: All right.

Laffer: They would love to be with us.

Gigot: Cut corporate taxes now, get the economy growing and then bigger tax reform later.

We're going to see if the president takes your advice.

Art Laffer, thanks for being with us.

Laffer: Thank you.

Gigot: Still ahead, a high-profile religious liberty case greets Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch with his first week on the job as talk grows of another high-court vacancy as early as this summer.

Gigot: Neil Gorsuch made his Supreme Court debut this week with the justices hearing argument in a closely watched religious liberty case. At issue in Trinity Lutheran is whether Missouri violated the Constitution when it barred a church-operated daycare and preschool in Columbia from participating in a state program that gives funding to nonprofits to upgrade their playgrounds. The outcome of the case could have far-reaching implications for future church-state disputes.

"Wall Street Journal" editorial board member, Collin Levy, joins us with more.

Collin, what is at stake here on religious liberty grounds in this case.

Collin Levy: Paul, this is a really important case because what you're looking at is a situation where the state was barring the church from participating in a program that was completely religiously neutral. The playground safety for children isn't actually a religious activity. So what the state --

Gigot: Last time we checked.

Levy: Not last time we checked. What the state was saying here is, you know, you can can't do this just because your church. That's very serious because the First Amendment guarantees a pretty narrow, clearly cut ban of what the government can do in regard to religion. You have to be able to exercise your religion freely and, on the other end, the government can't endorse an establishment of religion. So the justices were very skeptical in this argument that the state was acting properly.

Gigot: Right. I want to talk about that. But the genesis of the opposition in the state to this kind of allocation of money for neutral purposes goes back to something called the Blaine Amendment, which is -- you and I had written about this for years -- going back to the 19th century, named after James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, they said, when he ran for president. But he was a prominent American politician. And these amendments really were aimed at barring state money going to Catholic institutions. So there was a real anti- Catholic bias behind this.

Levy: There was really an anti-Catholic bias behind them, Paul. And what is so interesting is now these amendments are being used to block basically any religion from the public square. They are a big deal for a lot of state governments who are trying to use them against school choice programs because they're saying you can't have any situation where any public money from the state is flowing to any religious institution, even when it's a neutral purpose, as in this playground case, or in the Supreme Court -- in the voucher contact, where it is a parental choice issue. So it's a big thing.

Gigot: You have to love the irony of the left, using essentially an anti- Catholic provision of the state constitution for their modern political purposes.

McGurn: Yeah. Look, there has been a big switcheroo, as Collin pointed out and you were saying. The genesis of this was anti- Catholic. In fact, it wasn't anti-sectarian, although that's the language. They wanted a generic Protestant kind of faith. The red the King James Bible and so forth. The language now, which supported then Protestant schools, is now secular. So there has been a switcheroo in what they're trying to do.

The other thing is, it's absurd. We mock Medieval philosophers for counting the number of angels on pinheads, and now we have a Supreme Court trying to decide when a playground becomes religious or an act of a church.

Gigot: But, Dan, that transcript, I was really encouraged. You had Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, two of the more liberal justices, basically sounding real skeptical of the state being able to make these distinctions.

Henninger: The idea at the center of it is what Collin mentioned, something called the Neutrality Principle. Justice Kagan did say that, in her view, allowing funding to be used for the playground, was a neutral function. Her phrase, "neutral function."

Gigot: It's not religious.

Henninger: It's not religious. Now, in the 2002 Zelman case, which involved the Cleveland school voucher program, they won. And Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, said it was a neutral administered program. And joining him was Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. It was interesting that in that case, both Justices Breyer and Ginsburg voted against the Cleveland position. I would expect certainly Justice Ginsburg to hold the position on this. Justice Breyer wasn't so clear from the oral argument. He might be going over to where Justice Kagan is now.

Gigot: Collin, let's talk about the potential opening. Chuck Grassley, the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying he expects another Supreme Court seat to open in the summer. Is this wishful thinking perhaps on his part or is there some real possibility?

Levy: Paul, there's always a possibility. This speculation is going on inevitably because some of the justices on the court are rather old and we know, historically, that most presidents get two Supreme Court nominees, going back to Reagan. So there is always a possibility that this is can happen. I haven't seen any evidence that there is anything particular or any justice actually planning to retire. I think if we knew that, the justices would've said so. By the way, they're pretty good at keeping things to themselves. So I think when there is a justice about to retire, they're going to tell us.

Gigot: Yeah, the big question is whether Anthony Kennedy decides he wants to step down now to let a Republican president name his replacement. I think that is the one you have to watch.

All right. When we come back, President Trump President Trump returning this week to one of the central campaign themes, but will his Buy American/Hire American executive order deliver on his promise?

President Trump: The American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity. They voted to bring back their jobs and to bring back their dreams.

President Trump: I am proud to announce that we are about to take bold new steps to follow through on my pledge to buy American and Hire Americans. With this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world, we are going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and, finally, put America first.

Gigot: Present Trump in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Tuesday, where he signed his Buy American/Hire American executive order directive, playing off one of his main campaign promises to bolster protections for certain American-made goods and calls for a review of the H1B1 visa program for skilled foreign workers.

"Wall Street Journal" editorial page writer, Allysia Finley, joins us with more.

Allysia, a lot of big rhetoric here, but what is the actual practical impact of the Buy American provision?

Allysia Finley: It's likely not to have a big impact because, look, all the way back to the New Deal, we've had laws on the book's already favoring American products procurement.

Gigot: For federal government contacts?

Finley: Right. Exactly. There are also laws requiring that construction projects funded by the federal government use U.S. or steel. But there are exceptions.

Gigot: Is that what this is aimed at, those exceptions?

Finley: Supposedly. That is what Mr. Trump has said, and one of his spokesman. He said that federal officials are using these exceptions, exceptions that are inconsistent with the public interest. If costs are too high, if the products are unavailable in the U.S., it violates the free-trade agreement.

Gigot: OK, but it sounds as if there's not going to be that big of an impact, for example, on actually much change in what they buy and it won't affect the trade deficit much at all.

Finley: No. It's very symbolic. He is trying to fulfill a campaign promise to put American first, as we just heard. The bigger impact will be if he slaps tariffs on steel.

Gigot: That was a separate order, a memo that he issued this week, where he said, look -- asked the Commerce Department to review steel imports as, James, a national security threat.

James Freeman : Right.

Gigot: OK, national security steel imports?

Freeman: Yeah, it's kind of a reach here. It is a little-used law, especially over the last several decades. Theoretically, if we were unable to get steel imports from anywhere, this could be a concern. We have many allies with plentiful steel in their country so it's really not an issue. It's looking for a new way to attack steel imports. Because what is disappointing here is steel is very expensive in the United States compared to other countries. That may have something to do with the fact that the U.S. government already has more than 100 remedies in place trying to help U.S. steel and hurt foreign steel. This is an area where the government has already been implementing the Trump program and what it means is higher prices for us and everything that we buy, whether it's people making pipelines, automobiles, what have you.

Gigot: This is 232 provision of a 1962 law, which has been using the national security language in that law. It looks like Trump has already made up his mind, I'm going to slap tariffs on steel. Wilbur Ross , you find me an excuse.

Finley: Right. Exactly. They have to do this. He's saying you have to get this done in 40 or 50 days. You have all the way up to 270 but we're going to get this done fast. For legal reasons, they have to conduct this review. But they're just going to look for some kind of pretext, oh, wages of steelworkers have gone down, so ergo, we need to block here.

Gigot: Get your orders in now, Dan --

Henninger: Yeah.

Gigot: -- if you're a U.S. domestic steel user.

Henninger: Refrigerator, car.

Gigot: Whatever you make with it, transportation equipment, whatever, because the prices are going to go up.

Henninger: Yeah.

Gigot: What happened on the Bush years when they slapped --

Henninger: Yeah. Economists looked at what happened in the Bush years. It was a two-edged sword because jobs were lost in some of those industries. That used steel. Guess which states? Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump's states, he could be creating a reverse Trump phenomenon by putting people out of work in his states.

Gigot: Go ahead.

Freeman: It is going to get in the way of his infrastructure agenda. Like we need something else that is going to make projects more difficult and more costly and time-consuming. I don't know if it will be in league with environmental-impact statements, but to the extent it rolls out, it is going to make the infrastructure plan harder.

Gigot: Briefly, I mean, Democrats praised it. Chuck Schumer said, terrific, we love it.

Finley: Exactly, because it's favored by United Steel Workers Union in Pennsylvania and some other areas. But you know what? Some other unions, the Building Trades Union, the UAW , may not be very fond of it because steel is used in a lot of their products.

Gigot: All right. Thank you all.

We have to take one more break. When we come back, "Hits Misses" of the week.

Gigot: Time now for our "Hits Misses" of the week -- William?

McGurn: Paul, a miss for Bill de Blasio , who just announce he is making New York even more attractive for weapons dealers and smugglers.

That's not how the major put it but that is the implication of his bid to drive up cigarette prices to $13 a pack. Remember that the man who choked to death in police custody, Eric Garner?

Gigot: Right.

McGurn: That was over the sale of loosie cigarettes. So if Mr. de Blasio is serious about this, he will have more clashes between people selling untaxed cigarettes, as Eric Garner was, and the police. If he's not serious, all he's doing is allowing the people to flout the law while honest bodega owners and so forth see their sales diminish.

Gigot: Bill de Blasio , the best friend of black marketers.

McGurn: Yeah.

McGurn: Progressives, New York style.

Gigot: Allysia?

Finley: This is a hit to California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , who spoke to progressives this week. By refusing to denounce the Trump administration and refusing to support a single payer and, for that, she was booed by her audience.

Gigot: They don't like any kind of accommodation there at all.

All right, interesting.

James?

Freeman: This is -- I'll call it a hit to those adorable vegetarians who wrote really -- I'm going to give them a hit because they are innovating. "The Journal's" news site this week had a story about new butcher shops with no meat in them. They've come out with a whole new line of things that look like meat, cutlets, patties, barbecued ribs, all the things we love, except they aren't. They also have beet juice made to look like broth. Why this is appealing to vegetarians, I don't know. But knock yourselves out.

Gigot: So you'll be frequenting those shops?

Freeman: I think there is a reason people still seem to be looking for meat.

Gigot: All right.

Remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC.

That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.

The Resurgent Threat of al Qaeda; After bin Laden's death, it has become a vast and deadly network of groups spread from Syria to Yemen to Afghanistan

In the nearly six years since Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by U.S. Navy SEALs, the terrorist organization he founded has practically vanished from American news coverage. Al Qaeda has been eclipsed by the rise of the self-styled Islamic State— group that began as al Qaeda's Iraqi franchise but broke away in 2014.

It may appear that al Qaeda has simply declined, but that is very far from the truth. Since the death of its founder, it has transformed itself from a close-knit terrorist outfit with a handful of struggling affiliates into a vast network of insurgent groups spread from Southeast Asia to northwest Africa. Together, this network now commands an army of tens of thousands of Islamist militants. Years after bin Laden's death, they stand united in their commitment to his ideology. We have killed the messenger, but the message lives on.

In its first two decades, al Qaeda ("the base" in Arabic) focused on fighting the U.S. and its allies head-on. But in early 2011, amid the upheaval of the Arab Spring, bin Laden ordered an about-face in the group's aims. Instead of mainly pursuing the U.S. ("the far enemy"), he directed al Qaeda's franchises to turn inward and join the popular battle to bring down impious local Arab regimes ("the near enemy"). He hoped that this would build up al Qaeda's strength for an eventual showdown with the U.S. Bin Laden didn't live to see the fruits of this approach, but they have been considerable.

Islamic State was still formally part of al Qaeda when it made most of its territorial advances, and for the most part, it continues to espouse bin Laden's ideology. Islamic State is no longer aligned with al Qaeda, but sibling factions that remained loyal to al Qaeda have made stunning gains in their own right.

In Syria, more than 20,000 militants, according to regional press reports, follow the banner of the Liberation of the Levant Organization (formerly known as the Nusra Front), and they often battle their former jihadist comrades in Islamic State. In chaotic Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula holds major sections of coastline and highways, allowing it to run a smuggling network and to keep local populations loyal by distributing goods and services. Since the Arab Spring, al Qaeda's Yemen branch has more than quadrupled its membership, from about 1,000 to at least 4,000 fighters, according to State Department estimates.

Across the Gulf of Aden in Somalia, al-Shabaab—he affiliate responsible for the notorious Westgate Mall attack in 2013—as increased its membership to at least 7,000, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates. It continues to attract recruits, including from Somali communities in the U.S.

In northwest Africa, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb frequently targets Western tourists and aid workers. It recently absorbed several previously disparate factions, forming a jihadist conglomerate whose constituent groups (according to the Long War Journal) collectively carried out more than 250 attacks in 2016 alone.

Al Qaeda branches world-wide are gaining in numbers and fighting strength. Even in Afghanistan, where more than 2,000 U.S. soldiers have lost their lives battling al Qaeda and its Taliban allies since 9/11, U.S. forces discovered in 2015 the largest al Qaeda training camp to date, measuring some 30 square miles. Such groups are now more widespread and better armed, trained and organized than al Qaeda ever was while bin Laden was alive.

Bin Laden always envisioned an adaptable global network, and the new al Qaeda has distinct advantages over Islamic State. While the latter squanders blood and treasure defending its ever-dwindling "caliphate" in Syria and Iraq, al Qaeda's looser span across two continents makes it all but impossible to pin down. Where Islamic State focuses on the short-term (not least because it believes the End of Days is imminent), al Qaeda has demonstrated strategic patience, retreating and regrouping where necessary while keeping its eyes locked on its goals.

The most formidable al Qaeda franchises have embedded themselves within complex local conflicts in failing states such as Somalia, Yemen and Syria. If al Qaeda ultimately succeeds in these struggles, it will again possess stable home bases from which to launch ambitious attacks against the West. If it is defeated, it will simply morph again, from an insurgency back into a terrorist organization.

The same grim logic applies to Islamic State. After its self-styled caliphate falls, it will become what it was at its origins after the U.S. invasion of Iraq: an itinerant terrorist group, sowing chaos by murdering civilians—ost of them Muslim.

Such possible transformations raise the terrifying prospect of a reconciliation between al Qaeda and Islamic State. Today, the rival groups quarrel over the claim of Islamic State's "caliph" to lead all Sunni Muslims. But if Islamic State no longer governs territory, its leader is no longer a caliph, and the dispute falls away, opening the door to a merger between the groups. Whether they unite or not, it is only a matter of time before bin Laden's followers again turn their sustained attention back to the West and the U.S.

How should we respond to this threat? Military muscle alone won't do. We can kill as many terrorists as we want, but if more keep coming to fill jihadist ranks, we will make no headway. Defeating al Qaeda and its progeny requires cutting off their supply of recruits, and we can do that only by taking more effective action in the arena of ideology.

First, we must counter the false jihadist narrative that the West wants a "war against Islam." This would entail, for example, making good on our rhetoric about trying to end the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, avoiding the temptation to scapegoat all Muslims for the actions of a few terrorists and discouraging our leaders from inveighing against Islam itself.

We also must help to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophes that incubate terrorism. In Afghanistan in the 1980s, fundamentalist madrassas in refugee camps produced the Taliban—iterally, "pupils." We are now seeing a replay in Syria and Yemen, where millions of children go uneducated and face indoctrination by jihadists. Yet the Trump administration's budget plans threaten precisely the tools we need to meet these challenges—iplomacy and foreign aid.

Finally, we must do better at exposing the fundamental hypocrisy of a movement that claims to be the arbiter of true Islamic piety but routinely bombs mosques and marketplaces. We must craft a true and hopeful story to drown out the false and despairing one that terrorists tell.

Ultimately, the solution lies in tackling the root causes of radicalization, not just its symptoms. That is unlikely to generate footage exciting enough for cable news, but we can win only by becoming more tenacious than our enemy.

Mr. Soufan, a former FBI counterterrorism agent, is a private security consultant. This essay is adapted from his new book, "Anatomy of Terror: From the Death of bin Laden to the Rise of the Islamic State," which W.W. Norton will publish in May.

Suspect in Istanbul Terror Attack Was Killed in U.S. Raid in Syria Earlier This Month; Associate of Islamic State leader was behind New Year's Eve assault on nightclub, Pentagon says

WASHINGTON—n associate of Islamic State's leader who U.S. officials said was behind a terror attack in Istanbul on New Year's Eve was killed by U.S. forces in Syria in early April, the U.S. Defense Department said Friday.             

Abdurakhmon Uzbeki was killed during a U.S. ground operation on April 6 in which he was the target, officials said. Mr. Uzbeki was considered an associate of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and aided in the plotting of the attack on an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, said Col. John Thomas, spokesman for U.S. Central Command.             

"Uzbeki facilitated the movement of ISIS foreign terror fighters and funds and he also played a key role in ISIS external terror-attack plotting," Col. Thomas said. "We have clearly linked him with the Istanbul New Year's bombing."             

The Pentagon didn't provide further details on the nature of the ground operation. Col. Thomas declined to further comment on the precise relationship between Mr. Uzbeki and Mr. Baghdadi, or the slain militant's position in the extremist group's hierarchy.                           

In the New Year's Eve attack, a gunman opened fire at the nightclub, killing dozens. The alleged shooter, Uzbek citizen Abdulgadir Masharipov, was arrested in January by Turkish authorities, who haven't concluded that he was acting on behalf of Islamic State, even though the group claimed responsibility for the attack.

Trump Joins Criticism of Iran; Questions U.S. Role in Libya; U.S. president says Tehran is 'not living up to the spirit' of nuclear deal

WASHINGTON—resident Donald Trump, adding to strong criticism of the Iran nuclear deal voiced by his administration, said on Thursday that Tehran is "not living up to the spirit of the agreement."

His comments, in a joint press conference with Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, added to signals from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others that the Trump administration could back away from the landmark deal reached in 2015 between six world powers and Iran.

"We're analyzing it very, very carefully and we'll have something to say about it in the not-too-distant future," Mr. Trump said. "Iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement and they have to do that."

The Trump administration certified to Congress earlier this week that Iran is abiding by the accord, but senior officials have said they are reviewing whether to stick with the deal.

Mr. Trump's comments come a day after Mr. Tillerson made a rare public appearance to list U.S. complaints against Iran, complaining about its destabilizing activities in the Middle East, and faulted the agreement for focusing only on the nuclear issue.

Next week, Tom Shannon, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, will attend a meeting in Vienna with Iran and the other world powers who were party to the accord in what will be the first session with Trump administration representation.

Mr. Trump on Thursday also questioned another key U.S. policy position in the Middle East—its role in Libya. The Obama administration had carried out strikes against Islamic State and backed the Government of National Accord, which stemmed from a 2015 U.N.-brokered deal. The internationally recognized Government of National Accord has struggled to assert itself since then.

"I do not see a role in Libya," Mr. Trump said Thursday. "I do see a role in getting rid of ISIS."

It wasn't immediately clear whether Mr. Trump was signaling a shift in the U.S. position on Libya.

On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called for a "Libyan-led dialogue" backed by the U.N. to resolve continued fighting between warring factions. She called for all parties in Libya to abide by the 2015 U.N.-backed agreement and urged the Government of National Accord, or GNA, to "deliver for the country's people."

While the U.S. and other countries back the GNA, Russia in recent months has thrown its support behind a rival political organization led by Gen. Khalifa Haftar. The move has sparked growing concern at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Washington has largely kept its distance from Gen. Haftar, who has had links to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and was part of an effort to oust Moammar Gadhafi in the late 1980s.

European countries have lobbied Russia to use its influence with Gen. Haftar, who has received support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, to get him to reconcile with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

Democrats Get Smart in Georgia

Voters in Georgia's conservative Sixth District had a dizzying 18 candidates on the ballot Tuesday, though one in particular stood out.

It was the politician who touted a background of "working with our military and intelligence community to keep Georgians safe," and who vowed to "honor law enforcement." It was the candidate who boasted of being an entrepreneur, who promised to "reduce the tax burden" and "simplify small business tax filing." It was the candidate who promised to get rid of "wasteful spending" and "corruption" in Washington and to promote a "fiscally responsible economic policy."

That candidate? The Democrat. Jon Ossoff.

Republicans are crowing that they denied Mr. Ossoff an outright majority in Tuesday's jungle primary, and that he now faces long odds in a June 20 runoff against the GOP's Karen Handel, who is rapidly uniting the conservative side. They sought to make the race about the outside money backing Mr. Ossoff, as well as his residence outside the district and the fact that he's a liberal.

All this is true, yet it ignores the important point: Mr. Ossoff very nearly won. Republicans would do well to understand why. It wasn't some brewing backlash against Republicans, or any demographic shift, or a rejection of the Trump administration, or other Democratic talking points. He nearly won because after eight years of arrogance and electoral stupidity under Barack Obama, Democrats may be wising up.

In 2006 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, under then-chairman Rahm Emanuel, achieved a blowout House majority by running candidates who could win conservative districts. It was a different Democratic Party back then. Mr. Emanuel won by fielding moderates and Blue Dogs.

Mr. Ossoff is no Blue Dog. He's more a new breed of liberal populist. Dig into his positions and he checks nearly every progressive touchstone. He's for a federal "living wage." He's a climate crusader. He rallies for criminal-justice reform. He's pro-choice and against Citizens United. At the same time, however, he tries to tap the public discontent that fueled Mr. Trump. He rails against wasteful spending and corruption. He defends small businesses over "special interest" lobbyists. He highlights his interest in national security and condemns the "atrocities" of ISIS.

Mr. Ossoff and his backers very adroitly delivered his different messages to all the right crowds. In small events and phone calls and fundraisers, party elders pitched Mr. Ossoff's progressive positions to grass-roots activists. This reassurance, along with an acute desire to deliver Mr. Trump a defeat, drew liberal troops. The Daily Kos launched a full-throated online fundraising campaign for him. MoveOn.org endorsed him and ran a six-figure TV and digital ad campaign. The DCCC riled up key demographics, running targeted radio ads calling on African-American voters to "send a clear message to Donald Trump that racism and intolerance are never OK."

But in public or in large appearances, Mr. Ossoff delivered to conservative and moderate voters an uncontroversial message of national security, small-business support and swamp draining. He went so far as to promise to set up a dedicated investigative unit in his congressional office to root out "fraud" in the federal government. He hammered away at a pledge to bring high-tech jobs to the district. He rarely talked about Mr. Trump, and danced around ObamaCare.

This played well. Georgia's Sixth District leans conservative but sports quite a few affluent, educated moderates -- many of whom have doubts about Mr. Trump. The district went for Mitt Romney by 23 points, but Mr. Trump won by only 1.5 points. Despite all the focus on Mr. Trump's success with blue-collar, Rust Belt and rural districts, the Republican House majority depends just as much on keeping suburban and exurban districts like Georgia's Sixth. Mr. Ossoff's candidacy suggests this is where Democrats will make their play.

True, the Ossoff bid comes amid an escalating battle over the soul of the Democratic Party. This week featured a so-called unity tour between progressive firebrand Bernie Sanders and the Democratic National Committee's new chief, Tom Perez. There were a fair share of awkward moments, as when Mr. Sanders expounded on the need for single-payer health care, and Mr. Perez stared uncomfortably into the middle distance.

At one point, Mr. Sanders even took a shot at Mr. Ossoff, declaring that the Georgian wasn't a real "progressive." This, fascinatingly, earned Mr. Sanders a rebuke from none other than the Daily Kos, which declared that "the last thing we need is Sen. Sanders weighing in" on who fits "his ideal of a progressive." The post finished: "We cannot impeach Trump and pass a progressive agenda without a Democratic majority in Congress. Period."

Correct. And that very belated and intelligent assessment is why Republicans need to pay close attention to Mr. Ossoff and the Democratic strategy in Georgia. If the GOP doesn't start making good on its promises, it risks losing voters to Democrats who claim they can do better in Washington.

WASHINGTON—resident Donald Trump said Thursday he doesn't see a role for the U.S. in seeking to stabilize Libya, saying Washington should instead focus on combating Islamic State.

"I do not see a role in Libya," he said, speaking at a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. "I think right now the U.S. has enough roles," he added, citing its efforts in "getting rid of ISIS" as "very effective."

Speaking about Libya, Mr. Gentiloni called for nations to "work against the division of the country in order to stabilize it." He praised the U.S.'s anti-ISIS efforts in Libya to "prevent the consolidation of an important base for terrorism."

The U.S. is part of an international consortium behind Libya's so-called Government of National Accord, led by Faiez Serraj.

However, Russia has backed a rival political organization in recent months, throwing its support behind Gen. Khalifa Haftar, prompting growing concern at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Washington has largely kept its distance from Gen. Haftar, who has had links to the Central Intelligence Agency and was part of an effort to oust Moammar Gadhafi in the late 1980s.

European countries have lobbied Russia to use its influence with Gen. Haftar, who has received support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, to get him to reconcile with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

President Trump's decision to order missile strikes in Syria earlier this month, along with his statement that the country's future cannot include Bashar Assad, shows that the U.S. will not give the Assad regime and its allies a free hand. These moves instead have encouraged America's allies, including my country, Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. has been working closely with us for a long time to combat terror groups and to deter Iran and Hezbollah, often in ways the public doesn't see. Our support has been critical, but there are certain definitive actions that only the U.S. can take, certain voids that only the U.S. can fill.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands by our American ally, as we invariably have. We appreciate the many sacrifices the American people have made in our part of the world, and we understand their fatigue with combat. But the region is still very dangerous. Any perception that the U.S. lacks the resolve to act when necessary only encourages those who do not share America's noble values to step in.

This happened in Syria, where the Assad regime has waged unrelenting warfare on its people for six years. The Syrian government -- supported by Russia, Iran and its terrorist proxies in Hezbollah -- has killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians, created one of the worst refugee crises the world has ever witnessed, and facilitated the growth of Islamic State.

Iran continues to destabilize the region, both by stoking sectarian tensions and by aiding extremist groups. It is supporting subversive and terrorist activities in the Middle East and beyond, and it has even given sanctuary to the top-ranking leaders of al Qaeda.

Saudi Arabia is sandwiched between Iraq and Yemen, both of which are fighting to determine their future despite Iranian meddling. Iraq is in a struggle against ISIS while still trying to bridge the sectarian divides Tehran has been exploiting and provoking since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Yemen has been a base for attacks against Saudi Arabia. Its civil war -- provoked, fueled and sustained by Iran -- has cost thousands of lives while generating political and economic chaos.

Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have a shared view of the situation in the Middle East, and the major elements of our policies largely coincide. This augurs well for the possibility of bringing stability and peace to the region, but we are in for a long slog.

In Syria, our policy is to ensure a diplomatic solution to the crisis through the implementation of the 2012 Geneva I Declaration, which calls for a "transitional government body" with full executive powers that would include members of the present Syrian government and the opposition. Saudi Arabia believes that a political solution and a peaceful transition of power cannot be obtained without the removal of Mr. Assad. The Syrian people cannot accept or believe in a peace with him in power.

Last year, we stated our willingness to commit ground forces to Syria should the U.S. decide to lead a ground campaign against ISIS. Our objective would be to liberate territory from these terrorists and ensure that such areas do not fall under the control of Iranian-backed sectarian militias or the Assad regime. Saudi Royal Air Force jets operating out of the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey have conducted more than 340 strikes against ISIS targets in Syria as of February.

In Yemen we have rolled back Iran's attempt to gain a foothold in the region and supported the forces of the elected government. We want the Houthis to commit to a political solution based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 2216. This resolution requires the Houthis to withdraw from areas they have seized, relinquish their arms and cease all activities that properly belong to the government of Yemen.

Saudi Arabia is in the midst of a period of rapid modernization, and the quality of life of our people is our foremost concern. But that quality of life is at risk if we cannot make our region more secure. We will gladly bring our resources to bear on efforts to bring that about, but we have seen that it is only in working closely with the U.S. that our contribution can be truly effective.

We value our alliance with the U.S., and we believe that American power -- and the demonstrated willingness to use it judiciously -- can change the dynamics in the Middle East for the better. In the end, it is American power, reinforcing and complementing the work of America's allies in the region, that will bring stability and lasting peace.

World News: Saudi-Led Coalition to Focus on Protection From  ISIS

A Saudi-led coalition force of 41 countries is taking shape and has found a focus: protecting member nations against the threat from Islamic State as the militant group's strongholds in Iraq and Syria disintegrate.

The coalition, sometimes referred to as the "Muslim NATO," is expected to have its first substantive meeting over the next few months in Riyadh when defense ministers from member states, from Morocco to Malaysia, will gather to agree on its structure and mission.

However, these are Sunni-majority nations and absent from the alliance is Saudi Arabia's major rival in the Middle East, Shiite powerhouse Iran, which sees the grouping as a sectarian show of force.

The new coalition -- concerned over where in the Middle East and Africa militants from Islamic State could lodge themselves as their "caliphate" in Iraq and Syria collapses -- will set up a mobile military force to aid member countries that don't have strong counterterrorism capabilities. It also will battle other jihadist groups spilling out of war-torn Libya and Yemen, and Boko Haram in west Africa.

Under pressure from Riyadh, close ally Pakistan will provide a separate force of some 5,000 men to Saudi Arabia to help guard its vulnerable south, near the border with Yemen, Pakistani officials said.

At Saudi request, the coalition force will be led by the former head of Pakistan's army, Gen. Raheel Sharif, said Pakistani officials. Gen. Sharif was lauded for taking the fight to Pakistani militants.

Pakistan had said it wanted to focus on its battle with terrorism at home and stay out of the big confrontation in the Middle East between Riyadh and Tehran. Experts say the coalition will inevitably antagonize Tehran.

The military component is the focus of the alliance, which officials say is expected to be fully operational by year's end. Its command and control center in Riyadh recently began hiring staff. It will also seek to boost cooperation to combat extremist ideology and terror financing.

The alliance isn't restricted to confronting terror groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda, said Maj. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, an adviser to Saudi Arabia's minister of defense who is involved in assembling the new alliance. He said the coalition could move against rebel groups and militias that pose a threat to member countries.

Iran's ambassador to Islamabad, Mehdi Honardoost, said this month that he had protested Gen. Sharif's appointment to Pakistan and that Muslim countries "should come together to form a coalition of peace to resolve their issues rather forming a controversial military alliance."
