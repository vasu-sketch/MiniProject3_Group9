が新たな攻撃を仕掛ける動機があるとし 実行グループをまとめるか 自らが犯行に出る手段も手にしている可能性があると話す アタル容疑者はイラクのアブフレイブ刑務所に収容されていたこともあるが ベルギー政府などの要請で釈放された過去を持つ 現在はシリアに滞在していると思われ 過激派組織 イスラム国 に対してシリアで圧力がかかる中で自暴自棄な行動にでる可能性もあると政府関係者は話す ベルギー警察は数カ月にわたり アタル容疑者の親族の住居を捜査 同容疑者がどのような形でブリュッセルの事件に関わったのかを調べ 新たな攻撃を企てているかを探っている だが捜査関係者の注目が集まっていることが明らかになれば 焦ったアタル容疑者が何かしらの行動に出る可能性も高まるかもしれないと米政府関係者は話す ベルギー政府は11月にアタル容疑者の資産を凍結 またベルギーおよびフランス政府はここ数カ月の間に同容疑者の逮捕状を発行している 欧州や米国の捜査機関は アタル容疑者がブリュッセルの事件だけでなく2015年11月13日に発生したパリでのテロ事件にも関与したと考えている パリの事件では130人が犠牲になった またベルギー側の関係者によれば ブリュッセルの連続爆破テロ犯が使用していたノートパソコンには アタル容疑者が攻撃の標的や利用された爆発物の製造方法などについて語っている内容の記録が残っていたという アタル容疑者が 具体的にどのような役割を担ったのかは誰も知らないが 同容疑者は今ではパリとブリュッセルで発生した事件の首謀者の1人だったと考えられている と ベルギーを拠点にテロ事件や過激派組織を研究するピーター ファン オスタエイェン氏は話す モロッコ系ベルギー人のアタル容疑者は イラク中西部の都市ラマディにおいてイスラム過激派と共に活動していた疑いで米軍により拘束 アブグレイブ刑務所に収監されていた その後は多くの収監者と同様にイラク側に身柄を移され 禁錮10年の判決を受けた だが本人の健康状態を理由にベルギー政府や人権団体から申請を受け イラク政府はアタル容疑者を2012年に釈放していた 関連記事 ブリュッセル連続テロ 容疑者の1人逃走 欧州の小規模テロ

27 ウォール ストリート ジャーナル日本版 WSJOJP Japanese Copyright 2017 Dow Jones Company Inc 米ニューヨーク ブルックリンの連邦検察事務所の関係者は テロとの戦いで特別な武器を見つけたと考えている それはモー Mo という名の若い男性のことだ モーは28歳の米国市民だ 本名は伏せられている 2014年夏にニューヨーク市を離れ 出国した シリアで過激派組織 イスラム国 に加わるためだった 現地に到着後 すぐに幻滅したという 裁判書類によると 彼は現地入りして4カ月後に 私の帰国を支援してください という電子メールを米連邦捜査局 FBI に送った この邪悪さには もううんざりです FBIがこのメールの真偽の確認を続けている間に 彼は密入国業者の助けで逃亡し トルコにある米国務省の在外公館にたどり着くことができた 当局は14年11月 モーを米国に送還した 彼はブルックリンでテロに関する2件の罪を認めた ISのために建物の見張り役を務めたこと 他の新戦闘員たちにコンピューターソフトの使い方を教えたことをFBIに明かした それ以来 モーは米政府当局と異例な形で協力している ブルックリン在住の15歳の少年が暴力やISを支持するような内容をツイートすると モーが介入した 少年は説得され 今のところISへの参加を思いとどまっている モーは最長25年の禁錮刑に処される可能性がある 連邦裁判所による判決は今夏に下される見通しだ 異例な形のモーの活用は ブルックリンの連邦検察事務所が取り組む新たなテロ対策の契機になった 取り組みの狙いは 従来より早い段階で法執行当局が介入することだ 15歳の少年のようなテロの要注意人物が暴力や海外渡航に向けて大きく踏み出す前に説得する こうした要注意人物を精神衛生の専門家やメンター 助言者 モーのようなテロ組織からの離反者に引き合わせることも想定している この取り組みは ブルックリン検察事務所で国家安全保障 サイバー犯罪部門を率いている元保安官のセス ドゥシャーム氏が考案した インターネット上でテロリスト関連の脅威が増大するなか ソーシャルメディアに怪しげな投稿をするが刑事訴追には相当しない要注意人物がいる そうした要注意人物に対し 法執行当局は新たなアプローチを必要としているとドゥシャーム氏は語る 同連邦検察事務所の標的はグレーゾーンに入る要注意人物だ ドゥシャーム氏によると 方向変換し暴力から遠ざかる可能性のある 若者などが対象になる モーとの取り組みはユニークだ 他の地区の検察官らは IS離反者で信頼できる人や政府当局に協力しようとする人を探すのに苦労していると話す ブルックリン連邦検察にとっての大きなハードルは 早めの介入を受け入れそうな要注意人物を見極めることだ 元検察官らによると 逮捕前の介入は政府が監視していることを要注意人物に知らせることになり 本人は仲間との連絡を暗号化アプリに移行しかねない FBIの早期面会は失敗 皮肉なことに モーを巡る当局による当初の読み違いは早期介入がうまくいかない場合があることを示している FBIの捜査官は14年6月 ブルックリンの自宅で初めてモーと対面した ツイッターでの動きから疑念が生じていた 同地区でイスラム教徒として育ったモーは当時 コロンビア大学を中退し 学生ローンを返すためタクシー運転手として働いていた インタビューでは 当時は次第に信仰深くなり イスラムに関する答えをインターネットに求めていたと述べた そこで信頼できる学者を装ったテロリスト勧誘者たちに出会ったという 私は学校に行っていなかったから幻想に中に入り込んでしまった 裁判書類によると 彼はFBI捜査官と対面した際 シリア政府と戦っているグループを支持しているが そこに行くための資金がないと言った FBI捜査官は彼が脅威ではないと判断し 立ち去った 週間後 モーはイスタンブール行きの飛行機に乗っていた FBI捜査官による自宅訪問を受け イスラム法の下で生きたいのなら早く行動しなくてはならないと気付いたという Sがテロリスト集団であることを知っていたかと尋ねたところ 彼は懐疑的だったと話した 当時は あるグループをテロリスト集団にし 別の集団をそうでないとするものは何なのか と思い巡らせていたという イスタンブールに到着し 国境を渡ってシリアに入国した後は 他の新入りたちと共に生活した 食料はあまりなく 自分の命を常に案じながら 家から家へと転々としていた ISのメンバーたちが自爆用ベストやその他の暴力行為を正当化していると聞き 自分の成長と共にあったイスラム とは種類が違うと感じたという 幾度かのインタビューで モーはしばしば哲学用語を使って話した 彼が関心を抱いたのは いつ宗教性が急進主義に転じるのか という問題だったという モーは帰国して以降 検察官への支援に多くの時間を費やしている IS支持者からのツイートにある隠された意味を知らせるといった作業だ 裁判書類によると 当局に協力することで 残りの人生を刑務所で過ごさなくてもよくなる ことを願っていると当局者に述べている 将来の計画については テロの要注意人物をISのイデオロギーから解放するという政府の取り組みを支援し続けたいと語った 彼らは殺人が悪いことだと思っておらず 罪のない人を傷つけることを何とも思っていない連中だ と述べ そのことに私は無関心ではいられない と話した 関連記事 モスル奪還作戦 発見されたIS精鋭 訓練キャンプ トランプ氏が イスラム国 を b ISIS b0 と呼ぶ訳 モスル住民を人間の盾に ISの残忍な手口 Document WSJOJP0020170308ed38000rt U News Ex ISIS Recruit Aids Prosecutors Work includes

イスラム国 はイラクの主要拠点だったモスル近くの廃トンネル内に 新兵を訓練して精鋭に鍛え上げるための障害物コースを設けていた 有刺鉄線の下をくぐり 壁をよじ登るなどの訓練を施したもようだ モスル奪還作戦に従事するイラク軍が発見した シリアの遺跡都市にちなんで パルミラ と名付けられたこの訓練キャンプは イラク北部の都市モスル郊外の古い列車トンネル内にあり 長さは1 6キロメートル以上に及ぶ トンネル内は大がかりに改造され 障害物コースや射撃練習場 シャワー 医療施設などが完備されていた イラク軍のアブドゥル アメール広報官は テロリスト集団 最大のキャンプの一つだ と述べ 150人以上の新兵がここで同時に訓練できたのではないかと推測した 広報官は 明らかにこのキャンプは精鋭部隊や外国人兵士の訓練に使われた施設だ と述べた これまでに発見したキャンプとは全く違う 施設を見ると 新兵がいかに肉体的苦痛と 洗脳 を織り交ぜた過酷な訓練を受けたかがうかがえる 彼らはここでカリフ 予言者ムハンマドの後継者 を最高指導者とする カリフ制国家 を防衛するという戦士の使命を吹き込まれたのだ 廃トンネル中央の小さなモスクには ISが作成した宗教に関するテキストやIS発行の新聞が床に散らばっていた これらの印刷物は新兵がISの哲学だけに触れる環境を作る狙いがあった カリフ制国家のための戦いを正当化し 必要ならば命をささげるという哲学だ 重要な施設を失ったことは 米軍主導の有志連合が支援するモスル奪還作戦が進むにつれ ISの領土維持が一段と難しくなったことを印象づける イラク軍は1月下旬 モスルのチグリス川東側の地域を制圧した 破壊されたインフラの建設がすでに始まり 店舗が営業を再開するなど住民は以前の生活を取り戻そうとしている ここ数日はイラク軍がISと市街戦を繰り広げた 2日にはイラク軍がモスル西部で狙撃兵の隠れ家を突き止めた 携行式ロケット弾を3発打ち込んだが効果はなく さらに大量の無反動式砲で爆破したところ 狙撃兵の発砲がやんだ Sのモスル地区指導者の アブ サリム であるとイラク軍が特定した戦士は 中庭付近で死亡していた 遺体は足を格子柄のスカーフで縛られており ISの衛生兵が止血に失敗したとみられる イラク軍関係者によると モスルの最後の抗戦に加わった戦士の少なくとも一部は パルミラ キャンプで訓練を受けた公算が大きい 廃トンネルの両端には大量の土嚢が積み上げられ 予想される空爆に備えていたもようだ 障害物コースには 市街戦の基礎を教えるための小さな家の模型もあった コースの端にある看板は その先にカラシニコフ自動小銃 AK47 の射撃場があることを示していた 関連記事 ISのドローン

の危険な誘惑 WILLIAM PESEK 2 688 word 20 February 2017 10 03 ウォール ストリート ジャーナル日本版 WSJOJP Japanese Copyright 2017 Dow Jones Company Inc 投資家のための専門誌 バロンズ のコラム ドナルド トランプ米大統領が貿易戦争を始めるのではないかとの懸念は 2月に入って大きく後退した トランプ氏と中国の習近平国家主席との電話会談は 対決色よりも融和色が強かった さらに トランプ氏がフロリダ州の別荘に招いた安倍晋三首相との親密ぶりは 日本の政府関係者を安堵 あんど させた トランプ氏が貿易政策を巡り中国に対してドル安誘導という最終手段に訴えることはないとの見方が広がりつつあるが 市場はそれをうのみにしてはならない 調査会社ゲイブカル ドラゴノミクスのアーサー クローバー氏は トランプ氏の姿勢があからさまに軟化したのは 人事 が原因であって それをそのまま真に受けることはできないと警告する トランプ氏が通商政策の実務を担うキーパーソンとして指名した商務長官候補のウィルバー ロス氏が上院で承認されれば その後は中国との対立が待ち構えている というのが同氏の見立てだ 筆者の考えは違う トランプ氏は 国内の不祥事から目を背けさせるには中国を激しく非難すれば良い と考えるのではないだろうか この戦術は中国に有利に働くことが多いとしてもだ トランプ政権は早くも混乱の極みにある 難民 移民の入国を制限する大統領令は 反イスラム 的と受け止められた 安全保障担当のマイケル フリン大統領補佐官は 就任前にロシア大使と接触していた疑いで事実上解任された 労働長官候補のアンディ パズダー氏は指名を辞退した さらに 事実と現実を巡る問題が後を絶たない こうした問題から注意をそらす方法として 中国やアジア諸国に難癖を付けるよりもましな方法はないのだろうか 難題を抱えるトランプ政権は 本末転倒 英語はワグ ザ ドッグ しっぽが犬を振る な行為に訴える誘惑があまりにも大きすぎ そして あまりにも明白すぎて それに負けるかもしれない この点に関しては筆者の考えが間違っていて欲しいが トランプ氏はアジアの各国首脳の手法を踏襲している形跡がいくつも見受けられる トランプ氏が米空調大手キャリアのメキシコ移転を助成金給付などで阻止したことは 日本株式会社 を手本としている トランプ氏のこうした対応は短期的なメリットこそあれ 長期的には経済的なインセンティブを悪い方向へゆがませるものだ トランプ氏のメディアに対する感情的な攻撃や もう一つの事実 戦法は あまりにも中国のやり方に似ている これは到底安心できない 何でもかんでも被害者を装う戦術は マレーシアが得意とするところだ 政治とファミリービジネスをあからさまに混同する姿は タイのタクシン チナワット元首相を想起させる そして政策面の変わり身の早さは フィリピンのロドリゴ ドゥテルテ大統領の手法を思い起こさせる トランプ氏は都合の悪いことが起きるたび 国民の注意をそらす方法として軍事行動に頼るかもしれない その場合は シリアへの地上部隊派遣や過激派組織 イスラム国 ISIS への大規模空爆が選択肢となろう 南シナ海で挑発行動に出ることも考えられる トランプ氏が中国製品に2桁の関税を課すと同時に 南シナ海に建設された 海軍基地 中国政府は基地建設を否定している に向けて空母を派遣すれば 支持者は喜び 米政権の問題は注目度が下がるだろう 異母兄の金正男 キム ジョンナム 氏の殺害を指示したとされる金正恩 キム ジョンウン 朝鮮労働党委員長が率いる北朝鮮も格好の標的となりそうだ もう1度繰り返すが 筆者のこうした考えは間違いであってほしい だが トランプ氏は 報道陣の目をそらすためツイッターで繰り返し大言壮語を吐いてきた 実際に政治危機に直面したトランプ氏がこの戦術を海外で用いかねない と考えてもおかしくない このリスクは習主席にも当てはまる 中国政府は 本土の大気汚染の原因となっている製造業中心の経済から サービス業中心の経済に移行しようとしているが それが意味するのは経済成長の大幅な鈍化だ スタンダード ライフ インベストメンツのエコノミスト アレックス ウルフ氏が指摘するように 中国は 政治の不透明さに加え 民間投資を大幅に落ち込ませた住宅市場の調整に苦しんでいる 中国共産党にとって これはまさに綱渡りの政策運営だ 中国経済を年7 のペースで成長させ 所得拡大を持続させなければ 共産党の正当性は揺らぎかねない 社会不安に陥るリスクが高まっているため 習政権は愛国主義に訴える戦略や検閲を強化してきた 例えば 15年に上海株式相場が暴落した際には 中国政府に打撃を与えることを狙った海外勢力の仕業という陰謀説を国営メディアが広めた その後も 政府系メディアは日本など近隣諸国を批判することで共産党の求心力を高めようとしてきた 中国が領有権を主張する南シナ海上空に防空識別圏を設定しようとしたり ベトナム近海に石油採掘装置を設置したり アジア海域で大規模な建設プロジェクトを進めようとしたりしている習政権を国営メディアは称賛している 国民の視線を賃金の伸び鈍化や環境汚染から地政学的問題に向けさせたいという誘惑は 習政権もトランプ政権も同じくらい大きい トランプ氏が中国を 攻撃 する場合 どのような方法が考えられるだろうか ゲイブカル ドラゴノミクスのクローバー氏はヤンメイ シェ氏との共同リポートで 輸入税の導入 為替操作国への認定 鉄鋼など過剰生産力を輸出している産業への反ダンピング措置などを組み合わせたものになると指摘している クローバー氏らは 政治的には一定の成果があるかもしれないが そのような対立は米国に不利な結果となる公算が大きい 中国に対する敵対的な措置は さまざまな実務的 法的リスクをもたらし 中国から強い抵抗にあうだろう しかも トランプ政権が長期戦略を構築している様子はほとんど見られない と述べている 一方 米大統領選でトランプ氏が当選する数週間前に 映画 ウワサの真相 ワグ ザ ドッグ の原作者 ラリー バインハート氏が トランポノミクス トランプ氏の経済政策 に異を唱えていたというのは示唆に富んでいる バインハート氏は中東の衛星テレビ局アルジャジーラ 電子版 で トランプ氏が中国やメキシコ 日本 ベトナムから雇用を取り戻したとしても 同氏が引き上げ不要と考える最低賃金を超える額を雇用主が 従業員に 支払う理由などあるだろうか と指摘していた だが 今の段階ですでに疑問視されている計画が拙速に取りまとめられ 苦し紛れに発表されたら いったいどうなるだろうか 経済に赤信号が再びともるのだろうか トランプ政権からはもっとばかげた措置が打ち出されている しかもその政権は発足からまだ1カ月しかたっていない トランプ新大統領特集 株高でも安心できない米中貿易戦争の恐ろしさ 米中貿易摩擦 より深刻な打撃受けるのは米国か 米国と中国 足並み揃えた方向転換 Document WSJOJP0020170220ed2k001jl World Jim Mattis Says U Iraq Take Oil U defense secretary ass
